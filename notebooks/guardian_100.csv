The Canadian author, 82, appeared in a short YouTube video to announce the project, attempting to flambé the one-off tome with a flame-thrower. Announcing the book, Penguin Random House said: “Across the United States and around the world, books are being challenged, banned and even burned. So we created a special edition of a book that’s been challenged and banned for decades. “Printed and bound using fireproof materials, this edition of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale was made to be completely un-burnable. It is designed to protect this vital story and stand as a powerful symbol against censorship.” As described by the Guardian in 2010, the 25th anniversary of publication, The Handmaid’s Tale “tells the story of Offred – not her real name, but the patronymic she has been given by the new regime in an oppressive parallel America of the future – and her role as a Handmaid. “The Handmaids are forced to provide children by proxy for infertile women of a higher social status, the wives of Commanders. They undergo regular medical tests, and in many ways become invisible, the sum total of their biological parts.” According to the American Library Association, The Handmaid’s Tale is among books most often challenged or banned in US schools. In 2006, in an open letter to a school district which attempted to ban the book, Atwood said: “First, the remark: ‘Offensive to Christians’ amazes me. Nowhere in the book is the regime identified as Christian. As for sexual explicitness, The Handmaid’s Tale is a lot less interested in sex than is much of the Bible.” Atwood’s book has risen to new prominence thanks to a TV adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss and a 2019 sequel, The Testaments, which won Atwood a second Booker prize. “Handmaid” costumes, red cloaks with white headdresses, have become a familiar sight at protests for reproductive and women’s rights. The auction of an “unburnable” edition of The Handmaid’s Tale comes ahead of an expected ruling reversing the right to abortion, to be handed down by a supreme court dominated by conservative justices.
In a new essay collection, Burning Questions, Atwood writes: “Women who cannot make their own decisions about whether or not to have babies are enslaved because the state claims ownership of their bodies and the right to dictate the use to which their bodies must be put.” Her “unburnable” book is being auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York until 7 June. By mid-morning on Tuesday, the price stood at $40,000. All proceeds will go to support Pen America in its “work in support of free expression”. Hosting a Pen gala in New York on Monday night, Faith Salie, a writer and comedian, said the book was “made to withstand not only the fire-breathing censors and blazing bigots but actual flames – the ones they would like to use to burn down our democracy”.",2022-05-24 14:52:56,147533
uk-news/2022/apr/29/eden-project-cornwall-installs-plastic-grass-to-stop-children-getting-muddy,UK news,Eden Project installs plastic grass to stop children getting muddy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/eden-project-cornwall-installs-plastic-grass-to-stop-children-getting-muddy,"The Eden Project in Cornwall has installed plastic grass in a children’s play area to stop them getting muddy. The garden is one of a number of organisations and public bodies laying artificial turf in what environmental campaigners say is an epidemic of plastic being laid across the UK. There was a surge in interest across the UK in buying artificial grass during lockdown, according to data on Google Trends. The growing fashion of installing plastic in place of natural lawns comes as artificial grass retailers are making increasingly loud environmental claims about their products. The latest development is artificial grass known as “air”, which manufacturers say is capable of purifying air pollution by oxidising organic components and malodours at a molecular level. Campaigners describe this as greenwash, and point out that natural grass already “cleans the air” via photosynthesis, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Grass also provides habitats for insects and worms, attracts birds that feed on invertebrates, and helps rainwater drain away. Richard Dowling, a campaigner, said the speed and scale at which natural gardens were being removed and replaced with plastic, was “a disaster” unfolding. “This is something that is rapidly taking over, and we need to treat it as a disaster now. If we lose all our gardens, our wildlife – which is already being pushed out by intensive agriculture and pesticides – will have nowhere to go.”
The UK has lost more of natural biodiversity since the industrial revolution than almost anywhere in Europe, a study by scientists at London’s Natural History Museum found. Dowling has launched a petition to introduce an ecological damage tax on artificial grass. Carlisle city council – which says in its mission statement on climate change it wants to play a full role in protecting the environment, was recently criticised for spending £50,000 on a pop-up park that used artificial grass. Somerset county council laid plastic grass on a roundabout and then sent an official to cut it with a strimmer. The Eden Project confirmed it had used plastic grass in a children’s play area. Its mission statement says it is dedicated to improving collective understanding of the connections between all living things … fresh air, clean water, fertile soil, rich biodiversity.” A spokesperson said: “To ensure the safety of the children enjoying this temporary play area, we took the decision to use durable and soft artificial grass that will be reused many times over. Real grass, in this context, would become mud within a few hours and therefore would not have been sustainable.” Research shows that plastic grass – which is most often made from a mix of plastics – polypropylene, polyurethane and polyethylene – increases the heat in areas where it is used. When it breaks down it can release microplastics into the environment, which are thought to be harmful to humans. There is little data on the carbon footprint of artificial grass, most of which is manufactured in China and Vietnam and shipped to the UK. “It is a fossil fuel product,” said Charlotte Howard, a gardener from Wiltshire campaigning for natural gardens. Howard says the boom in fake grass is being turbo-charged by social media influencers such as Mrs Hinch. Howard specialises in helping families in new-build homes whose gardens have poor soil as a result of developers stripping off and selling the top soil, leaving the garden with poor soil and no drainage. “When I have gone in to remove artificial lawns the mess is horrendous. They often stink, and when you lift up the plastic grass you find a sea of dead worms,” she said. Howard said despite the claims of manufacturers, artificial lawns were not maintenance-free. Pet faeces have to be scraped off, the grass pile has to be swept, weeds creep through, pet urine causes bad smells, and the plastic eventually breaks down, she said. Dr Robert Francis, an ecologist at King’s College London, is researching the ecological impact of plastic grass. “Artificial lawns meet the cultural requirements of ‘good’ lawns”, he wrote. “Yet they do so at the expense of any remaining ‘naturalness’ and embodiment of life.” He said his research had found artificial grass can increase urban flood risk because rainfall cannot drain away into the soil, leaving more of it to run off. The Association of Artificial Grass Installers did not respond to requests for comment.",2022-04-29 09:24:02,144415
music/2018/jan/26/grammys-2018-jay-z-despacito-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-lorde-bruno-mars,Music,Who will – and should – win the major categories at the Grammys 2018,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/26/grammys-2018-jay-z-despacito-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-lorde-bruno-mars,"Album of the year Awaken, My Love! – Childish Gambino 4:44 – Jay-Z Damn – Kendrick Lamar Melodrama – Lorde 24K Magic – Bruno Mars
This is the first time Jay-Z has been nominated for this award, on his 13th attempt, and so he could well be the Sam Rockwell of the Grammys – the person who will win because of a long career rather than their best ever work. But he has a titanic battle against Kendrick Lamar’s Damn. Jay is sequestered off from the most listeners in Tidal’s ivory tower – his album is invisible on the streaming services used by the vast majority of people – while Lamar’s is not; there is no doubt as to which MC is at the heart of today’s hip-hop culture, and whose flow is most exciting. Giving it to Jay, when his wife was denied the same award last year by Adele, is an optical wrinkle that academy voters may want to avoid, too. But then again, it’s a thoughtful, frank album, dubious opinions about Jewish property ownership aside – and Jay continues to teach Lamar everything he knows about turning solipsism into social commentary, be it making your passage from the ghetto a Horatio Alger story, or ruminating on your own blackness as a way to explore everyone else’s. Jay is also an icon of the US music industry, and is under-rewarded, at least in terms of major gongs. With her raw-hearted, anthemic songwriting – and her sheer charisma and iconography – Lorde has a chance, but the lack of dial-shifting hits will wither her challenge. Awaken, My Love! is a little too uneven to win, and Mars’s album is very entertaining, but the sheer level of pastiche makes it a worthy winner of the 1987 award. Will win: Jay Z Should win: Kendrick Lamar Record of the year Redbone – Childish Gambino Despacito – Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee feat Justin Bieber The Story of OJ – Jay-Z Humble. – Kendrick Lamar 24K Magic – Bruno Mars
There is hopefully only one game in town here: to not give the award to Despacito, a song that rang out from barrios to boarding schools on its way to 4.7bn YouTube views, would be scandalous. Prejudiced, even. It has dominated the zeitgeist and done so with the rarest of things, an elegant earworm. Jay has no chance here – you don’t win this without a smash hit – and Lamar’s Humble isn’t quite blockbuster enough either, while voting for Mars’s 24k Magic seems fluffy and featherweight in comparison. Childish Gambino’s Redbone could be the curveball – a huge radio hit all year long in the US, its chorus of “stay woke!” defined 2017 like no other. An academy wanting to prove it wasn’t #SoWhite might get behind it – especially as it is an exceptional, sensual song. But to do so would be to cut off their nose to spite their face: if they want to champion diversity, they should choose the Latin pop song that took over the world. Will win: Despacito Should win: Despacito Song of the year Despacito – Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee feat Justin Bieber 4:44 – Jay-Z Issues – Julia Michaels 1-800-273-8255 – Logic feat Alessia Cara and Khalid That’s What I Like – Bruno Mars
Record of the year is about the songwriting, production, and – tacitly – the entire social impact of a track; song of the year homes in on lyricism and melody. Given the Spanish lyrics and a predominantly anglophone academy, Despacito is unlikely to win, though its sheer catchiness might see it through. The candid self-flagellation of 4:44 is affecting, but it didn’t even break the US Top 20; Julia Michaels’ Issues is equally soul-baring, but to my ears has too earthbound and unoriginal a melody to win. Mars’s lyric sheet is too basic – even if gloriously so – leaving the simple, hugely affecting suicide prevention anthem 1-800-273-8255 from Maryland rapper Logic. The sheer clarity of his chorus, borne upwards with perfect melodic, well, logic, allowed many to find words for their psychic strife – he is the pop star for the age of anxiety. Will win: 1-800-273-8255 Should win: Despacito New artist Alessia Cara Khalid Lil Uzi Vert Julia Michaels SZA
The strongest field for this award since 2014, when Macklemore beat Lamar and got all white guilt about it. Khalid and Lil Uzi Vert are the go-to artists for drowsily existential millennial angst; Julia Michaels and SZA are the go-to artists for brazenly sexual millennial angst; and Alessia Cara is the go-to artist for drowsily existential, brazenly sexual millennial angst. SZA is up against some blue-chip competition in her other five categories – though a clean sweep is by no means beyond her – so hopefully she will bring this one home. The strength of Michaels’ CV, co-writing for Katy Perry et al – and with the industry needing a big new female star – may see her anointed instead. Will win: SZA Should win: SZA Pop solo performance Love So Soft – Kelly Clarkson Praying – Kesha Million Reasons – Lady Gaga What About Us – Pink Shape of You – Ed Sheeran
Given that Sheeran was snubbed in the top three categories, he will be swamped with votes for what was perhaps the definitive English-language pop song of 2017. Kesha will have some loyal support given an extremely rough few years, but Pink’s, Kelly Clarkson’s and Lady Gaga’s songs are derivative, frankly B-list material put next to their impressive discographies. Sheeran should also win the pop vocal album category. Will win: Shape of You Should win: Shape of You Rock album Emperor of Sand – Mastodon Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct – Metallica The Stories We Tell Ourselves – Nothing More Villains – Queens of the Stone Age A Deeper Understanding – The War on Drugs
After Cage the Elephant – a half-hearted shrug made manifest in leather trousers – won last year, it’s nice to see some bands whose guitar lines might not topple over in a light breeze: Mastodon, Queens of the Stone Age, Metallica and Nothing More all have the riffs that this category deserves. The War on Drugs seem to have wandered in from the alternative category, their beautifully gauzy anthems now just big enough to rock. It’s the best album here but probably won’t win over the voting bloc. Metallica are as spunky and gleeful as they’ve been in years, and that pep should see them through. It would be nice for the breakthrough act Nothing More, and their abdominals, to win something from their three noms though. Will win: Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct Should win: A Deeper Understanding Rap performance Bounce Back – Big Sean Bodak Yellow – Cardi B 4:44 – Jay-Z Humble – Kendrick Lamar Bad and Boujee – Migos feat Lil Uzi Vert
Another strong category, like a wild night out interrupted by your mate moaning on about their relationship woes. But on turf he has helped define, Jay-Z could well win. The exquisite equipoise of Lamar’s wordplay makes him a strong contender, and the same is true to a slightly lesser extent with Big Sean. Migos’s own waltz-time flow has had greater influence this year than both of them, though lyrically they’re more conservative. But if we’re talking rap performances, surely Cardi B’s magnificent Bodak Yellow will triumph. The chorus makes an infernally catchy melody out of almost nothing – with the petulance distilled into “I don’t wanna choose” Oscar- as well as Grammy-worthy – and she can freeze-dry opponents’ confidence with a single withering syllable: “bitch”, “opp”, “look”. Just imagine her acceptance speech. Will win: Bodak Yellow Should win: Bodak Yellow Country solo performance Body Like a Back Road – Sam Hunt Losing You – Alison Krauss Tin Man – Miranda Lambert I Could Use a Love Song – Maren Morris Either Way – Chris Stapleton
It may not be a big category to passing British readers, but this is a fascinating face-off between the diverse, sometimes warring factions of country music. The biggest hit here is Sam Hunt’s Body Like a Back Road, the most bro-country song title since Joe Nichols’ Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off. My guess is academy voters will hoist their noses aloft and head towards something a bit deeper. Maren Morris’s mid-tempo I Could Use a Love Song is fresher and more robust than Miranda Lambert’s wafty ballad, but the spare, rootsy Chris Stapleton will please big swaths of august voters who use the phrase “real music”, and his voice is a timeless instrument. Losing You, by 27-time winner Alison Krauss, is perfectly good, but many will feel it’s time for a changing of the guard. Will win: Either Way Should win: I Could Use a Love Song",2018-01-26 12:11:12,47554
technology/2018/apr/24/facebook-replacement-openbook-challenge-social-media,Technology,Is Facebook replaceable? Tech investor launches bid to 'start the process',https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/facebook-replacement-openbook-challenge-social-media,"Can Facebook be replaced? The prominent Silicon Valley investor Jason Calacanis, who was an early investor in several high-profile tech companies including Uber certainly hopes so. He has launched a competition to find a “social network that is actually good for society”. The Openbook Challenge will offer seven “purpose-driven teams” $100,000 in investment to build a billion-user social network that could replace the technology titan while protecting consumer privacy. “We want to invest in replacements that don’t manipulate people and that protect our democracy from bad actors looking to spread misinformation,” the challenge website states.
The seven winning teams will be invited to join Calacanis’s Launch incubator, offering them 12 week of mentorship as they develop their social network. “All community and social products on the internet have had their era, from AOL to MySpace, and typically they’re not shut down by the government – they’re slowly replaced by better products,” said Calacanis in a blogpost announcing the challenge. “So, let’s start the process of replacing Facebook.” Calacanis, who was an early investor in Uber and Thumbtack and has written a book called Angel – How to Invest in Technology Startups – Timeless Advice from an Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000, points to two reasons why Facebook has not yet been displaced. “First, Zuckerberg has done an exceptional job of buying competitors,” he told the Guardian. “Instagram and WhatsApp were well on their way to disrupting Facebook when Zuck masterfully bought them out, sealing his monopoly position. The data they have across these three platforms builds an unprecedented moat.” The second reason is Zuckerberg’s ability to “quickly steal innovative features from startups that refuse to sell to him, like Snapchat”. “Zuck’s ‘sell or die’ threat has put a paralysis into the venture and entrepreneurial communities, making both scared to challenge him,” he added. A “particularly nefarious” aspect of Facebook’s dominance is how it can use the data collected from the “like” button, its ad network and the “login with Facebook” tool to keep track on the competitors getting the most traction and, Calacanis said, “kill them before they hit scale”. Teams have until 15 June to submit either a video tour, prototype or “full-blown product”. Over the following 90 days, 20 finalists will be whittled down to just seven companies, who will each receive $100,000 in return for a 6% stake in their business. Finalists will be selected based on their “ability to execute” as opposed to the idea. “No matter how strong a big company is, there is always a chance that an indefatigable founder with a clever idea and a kick-ass team will be able beat them,” he said. Facebook’s approach to privacy has come under intense scrutiny over the last few weeks, following the revelation that the personal data of millions of Americans was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Stoked by fears that the data may have been used to try to influence the 2016 presidential election, some users have been horrified to discover the amount of data Facebook collects about them, including facial biometrics, web-browsing history and, in some cases, their text messages. While many Silicon Valley luminaries have only recently started to scrutinise the 2.2bn-strong social network, Calacanis has been a consistent and vocal critic. In 2009 he recorded an “open message” to Zuckerberg – a video posted to YouTube – in which he said: “You have no idea what you are doing when it comes to privacy. You have a lack of leadership at your company when it comes to privacy and you have a glib and reckless approach to people’s privacy. “You are a brilliant engineer who is creating a level of mistrust with his users that is unprecedented and obnoxious.”
Despite his concerns about the platform, Calacanis also acknowledges Facebook’s positive attributes. “Social networks are amazing at letting families and friends stay in touch with each other, and the filters on Instagram make our photos look 100% more beautiful –these are wonderful innovations.”",2018-04-24 19:35:23,53471
us-news/2019/jun/30/democrats-impeach-trump-pelosi-congress-pressure,US news,Democrats divided as pressure to impeach builds: ‘What are you waiting for?’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/30/democrats-impeach-trump-pelosi-congress-pressure,"In the House of Representatives the apparently frustrated Democratic congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, had one question for the leadership of her party: when would they impeach Donald Trump? “The thing that we’re struggling with is that we don’t know what we’re waiting for in terms of a caucus. And folks that are saying, ‘No, not yet. Not yet.’ OK – accepting that that’s your position, what are you waiting for?” the New York socialist said to reporters this week. “Are you waiting for some kind of revelation?”
That’s a question a growing number of Democrats are asking. Dozens of Democrats on Capitol Hill, including 2020 hopefuls such as Elizabeth Warren, have called for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s damning report into Russia interference in the 2016 election, which also outlined numerous instances of obstruction of justice on the part of the president. Nor is it just leftwing firebrands like Ocasio-Cortez. One notable recent convert to the impeachment cause was California congresswoman Katie Porter, who announced her support by admitting: “I didn’t come to Congress to impeach the president.” But Porter added: “When faced with a crisis of this magnitude, I cannot with a clean conscience ignore my duty to defend the constitution.” Porter’s support struck a chord in Washington because, as the representative of a swing district, her announcement carried personal political risk. Most others who have called for impeachment hail from safely blue districts. Only one Republican – Michigan congressman Justin Amash – has signed up to the cause. The question now is, will the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, succumb to the growing pressure, or will she stand her ground? It is a fierce debate that is increasingly dividing the party, pitting pragmatists against ideologues, the leadership against its own members and advocates of policy who believe they have a constitutional duty to act against wrongdoing against those who prefer to wage politics and want to remove Trump by thrashing him at the 2020 ballot box. Pelosi has so far remained steadfast in opposing an impeachment inquiry on the grounds such a move would fail in the Republican-controlled Senate and could be politically divisive, potentially jeopardizing Democrats’ chances at ousting Trump via the ballot box in 2020. In March, she said in an interview with the Washington Post that impeachment would be “so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path”. A four-page summary later that month of Mueller’s report by William Barr, the Mueller critic Trump installed as attorney general, made that position seem prescient. Barr wrote in a letter to lawmakers that Mueller did not establish collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that he’d punted on the issue of obstruction. Barr and his then deputy, Rod Rosenstein, cleared Trump of charges that he sought to interfere with the inquiry.
But in April, Barr released a redacted version of Mueller’s 448-page report that revealed his initial summary – and a bizarre, pre-publication press conference in which the attorney general sought to spin the findings like he was a member of Trump’s defense team – to be wildly misleading. On the question of obstruction of justice, Mueller laid out a series of episodes in which Trump personally sought to undermine the investigation, including by firing former FBI director James Comey and attempting to fire the special counsel himself. The reason Trump was not charged with a crime, Mueller implied, is because he did not believe justice department protocol allowed for a sitting president to be indicted. Holding the president accountable, he suggested, would necessarily be Congress, not the criminal justice system. For some Democrats, like the congressman and 2020 presidential candidate Eric Swalwell, that was a call to action. “The congressman is concentrated on protecting our democracy and believes that a fair process will either remove a corrupt president or acquit him but inaction is no longer an option,” a representative for Swalwell said. The momentum behind impeachment may be having some impact. Pelosi has introduced the word into her vocabulary as of late, implying that she was keeping the door open to the possibility. But she has also stayed the course, tamping down criticism from her ranks that it’s Congress’s duty to hold the president accountable – regardless of whether it would succeed or not. Instead, she has called for Democrats to press on with their investigations, as well as to focus on kitchen table issues such as healthcare, which helped them take back the House in the 2018 midterms and can, she hopes, propel them to victory again in 2020. As the 2020 race heats up – the Democrats have had their first televised debate and Trump has officially launched his campaign – it is hard to say what Democrats will, or should, do. On the one hand, impeachment could prove divisive. While a growing majority of Democratic voters support such a move, some polls suggest that Americans overall remain split on the matter. There are fears that impeachment could backfire on Democrats in 2020 and gift Trump another four years in office are not completely unfounded. After all, Republicans lost House seats in 1998 and 2000 as they pursued the impeachment of Bill Clinton – something that has weighed on Pelosi, her colleagues told the Atlantic. Those losses are often overstated, however, and the situations are different, both in terms of the two presidents’ statures in the public’s eye and the nature of their conduct. Clinton, who retained high approval ratings during the course of his proceedings, was impeached over conduct largely unrelated to his presidency.
Trump, on the other hand, has seen underwater job approval ratings for the entire duration of his presidency. What’s more, the justification for his potential impeachment cuts to the heart of his duties as president. Trump has not only continued to insist he did nothing wrong and to block oversight investigations – he also said in a stunning interview recently that he would welcome foreign interference in the 2020 election if he thought it could help him win. Though Democrats appear uniformly frustrated and outraged by Trump’s conduct, some aren’t yet ready to greenlight impeachment. “I’m not yet calling to start an impeachment inquiry,” Florida congressman Ted Deutch, a Democrat on the House judiciary committee, told the Guardian. “But I will also not keep waiting as the White House engages in this unprecedented stonewalling. Obstruction of an investigation of obstruction of justice is itself obstruction of justice.” For more than 70 lawmakers and counting, though, it’s time to start moving on the matter – both as a practical way of holding the president accountable and as an ethical and constitutional responsibility to send a message that nobody is above the law, even if they sit in the Oval Office. “The administration has refused to respect the rule of law,” Porter said announcing her support for an impeachment inquiry. “The question is not whether a crisis is in our midst,” she continued, “but rather whether we choose to fight against it.”",2019-06-30 04:00:06,79238
australia-news/2021/dec/30/australias-new-years-eve-may-be-a-damp-squib-as-revellers-make-their-own-covid-decisions,Australia news,Australia’s New Year’s Eve may be a damp squib as revellers make their own Covid decisions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/australias-new-years-eve-may-be-a-damp-squib-as-revellers-make-their-own-covid-decisions,"Officially the new year parties in Australia’s largest cities will go ahead as planned, despite Covid case numbers exploding around the country. But the night seems set to be much quieter than usual, as individuals dampen their plans, rethinking trips to the usual hotspots in Sydney and Melbourne, and cancelling larger parties or putting caps on numbers, amid warnings from epidemiologists that the night could become a super-spreader event. There were 11,201 positive cases reported in New South Wales on Wednesday and 3,767 in Victoria, with South Australia and Queensland also both well over 1,000. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has urged people to head out and enjoy the party and large crowds are expected to watch the famous fireworks in Sydney.
The City of Sydney said it could not predict how many people would turn out, but five of the six locations it manages were sold out, with about 17,000 tickets booked. Tickets were still on sale on Wednesday for 25 other locations, with capacity for almost 87,000 people. But many private businesses are shutting up shop. One of Sydney’s biggest dance parties, Mad Racket, has cancelled its New Year’s Day event, which was originally set to draw a crowd of 400. “I already had a lot of people I was giving refunds to because people are becoming uncomfortable,” co-founder Simon Caldwell said. “The general vibe was safer to [shut down] than not do it. For people to wear masks indoors when they’re dancing, it’s not the vibe.” He said the suppliers and venue had lost money, but that it was a safer option. “It’s not about shaming anyone who is going ahead, everyone had to make their own call – which sort of made it more difficult in a way because it wasn’t clearcut.”
Neesha Chockalingam, 21, had planned to go dancing in Sydney for New Year’s Eve, but one person in her friendship group caught Covid last week, so now they were winding it back to a small party in the park. “We made the decision last week when one of us got Covid,” Chockalingam said. “It ruined our plans because we’re a close friend group, we didn’t want to do it without him. “There’ll be probably not more than five to 10 people. It’ll be small scale.” Melbourne revellers are also weighing up their options. Many are expected to flock to Flagstaff Gardens, Treasury Gardens, and Docklands to watch the fireworks, but some have had second thoughts. . Savannah Benson lives in Canberra but had planned to spend New Year’s Eve with a friend in Melbourne. They made a pact – if Victoria’s case numbers hit 2,000 a day they would cancel the trip. “It was less a concern about actually catching Covid because we both live in Canberra so the risk is there anyway, but more so uncertainty over what would happen if we caught it or became a close contact,” she said. Elliot, who did not want his last name to be used, lives in Tamworth, NSW, with his young family. They had planned to have a large party with extended family and friends, but cut it to an intimate gathering after seeing the case numbers rise. “Now we are down to the micro-bubble of immediate family,” he said. “If it had not been this ridiculousness it would have been a much bigger family and friends party.” He said it was hard to act in your own health interests when there was so much Covid in the state. “I wish our commonwealth and state government would prioritise the health outcomes of its citizens rather than the economic outlook of the state.”
Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and adviser to the World Health Organization, said it would be “disappointing” if the two governments let their public celebrations go ahead. “I would have expected the authorities to do leadership during hard times and that leadership means trying to save people from infection,” she said. “They’ve had months to understand Australia has a super-spreader event this time of year. The same thing happened last year. “If there is a circulating virus the same thing will happen next year. This is part of outbreak management. I am shocked at the lack of planning to slow down the outbreak.” McLaws said there should also be caps on home visits. “There need to be home capacity limits and, in fact, everyone going to a home should certainly be using a [rapid antigen test] if they all haven’t recently had a booster shot.” She said parties should be moved outside and those attending should wear masks at all times. “And if you can’t risk staying at home because you’re too unwell [in the coming weeks] to go to work, then maybe think about enjoying a celebration from home with your household. Think about it very carefully.”",2021-12-29 16:30:26,136819
business/2016/jan/30/rent-bills-high-enough-student-rebel-accommodation-goldman-sachs,Business,Rent bills high enough to make any student rebel,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/30/rent-bills-high-enough-student-rebel-accommodation-goldman-sachs,"More than 150 students in two halls of residence at University College London are currently on a rent strike, demanding a 40% cut in their weekly accommodation fees. The problem is places like Max Rayne House – a self-catered student house where a twin room costs £102.97 a week while a one-bed flat is £232.40 and bathrooms are shared between 10-13 people. David Dahlborn, a third-year history student and one of the campaigners, reckons the rising rents “will lead to a growing student debt crisis” and says the blame for increasing costs lies at least partly with new specialist private providers of student accommodation, who are in the business for profit. He says: “The private sector is pushing rents up year after year, and universities like UCL are pushing their rent up as well.” Building and providing student accommodation is a growing sector of the property market. Investors have been piling in, including private equity firms, to take advantage of the boom in purpose-built student housing. A record £6bn was invested in it last year – more than in north America, according to law firm Addleshaw Goddard. Investors are attracted by the high income returns due to strong demand: students numbers are rising every year and there is a shortage of adequate accommodation. Last year a record 532,300 new students started at university and numbers are likely to keep rising after the cap on domestic and EU students at English universities was lifted last year. Some of the accommodation now being built is a world away from Max Rayne House and traditional student halls. They include studio flats or en suite rooms with luxury showers, fast broadband, kitchens with stainless steel appliances and dishwashers, 24-hour security, on-site gyms and cinemas. And they charge rents way out of the budget of most students. Overlooking Westminster Bridge in central London, Urbanest’s silver-clad oval tower bears a closer resemblance to an office block. It opened in September and houses 1,140 students over 18 floors, with a gym and swimming pool in the basement. There’s also a 33-storey skyscraper built by American private equity firm Blackstone in the City of London that houses up to 1,140 students. It has a bar and lounge on the top floors, along with a gym, library, cafes, post room, cinema, games and karaoke rooms. En suite rooms in two-bedroom apartments start at £265 a week and go up to £495. Single studio flats are £385-£699 a week. Hollie Packman, a third-year chemistry student at UCL, says: “I know very few people apart from international students who could afford that.”
She pays £150 rent a week for a two-bed council flat in Camden shared by four people. A lot of London students have to live far out and commute to university, she says. The new private residences are popular with overseas and postgraduate students, who are more likely to be able to afford them, especially in central London. At Urbanest, less than a third of residents are British, 13% are American and 12% Chinese. Last week, US investment bank Goldman Sachs set up a new student housing venture called Vero Group. It is combining Wellcome’s student housing, which Wellcome has been investing in since 2007, with units already owned by property fund Greystar. Vero starts with a portfolio of 23,500 beds in 25 towns and an ambition to become the UK’s leading student accommodation provider. The biggest such company currently is the FTSE 250 listed Unite Group, with 46,000 beds across the UK. It charges up to £230 a week in central London and £120-£140 in the regions. Studios in central London, however, cost £350 or more a week. Chief executive Mark Allan compares it to running a large-scale hotel business. “The operators are more professional and better capitalised [than in the past]. That’s better for universities and students.” Shelly Asquith, the National Union of Students’ vice-president for welfare, says that the private sector is on track to become the main supplier of purpose-built student accommodation nationally by 2018 – it already is in London – and wants to ensure it caters for all students, not just wealthy ones. She is worried about the growth of studio flats, particularly in London. “This is the most expensive student accommodation being provided in the centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world: of course it is nice, but is it really serving an educational need?” Asquith says. “What is certain is that it is pulling rent levels to new heights – well over £10,000 a year for a small studio flat. We may be at the point where enough is enough.”",2016-01-30 16:00:02,320
australia-news/2019/aug/31/biloela-tamil-asylum-seeker-family-moved-to-christmas-island,Australia news,Biloela Tamil asylum-seeker family moved to Christmas Island,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/31/biloela-tamil-asylum-seeker-family-moved-to-christmas-island,"A Tamil asylum seeker family has been moved to Christmas Island after being given a reprieve against deportation from Australia until Wednesday. Supporters said they lost contact with the family on Friday night, and learned just after 2am that they had arrived at a detention centre on the island, north-west of Australia. In a statement the Home to Bilo group said the family’s solicitor, Carina Ford, had been notified of the move in a notice received from the immigration department during the night. Priya, her husband Nadesalingam and their Australian-born children Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, had been held at a Darwin military base. Priya was able to make contact with family and friends when they arrived at Christmas Island. “My children have been separated from their world,” she said. The move comes after a judge issued a last-minute injunction to halt their deportation from Melbourne to Sri Lanka on Thursday night.
The family landed in Darwin after the order was made and were taken off the plane. On Friday, there was another glimmer of hope. A Melbourne court ordered the government not to expel the youngest child until a further hearing on Wednesday. The family’s legal team say only Tharunicaa is protected under the ruling because her claims for asylum protections have never been assessed. The rest of her family could be expelled as their legal avenues have been exhausted but Ford said Australia would be condemned if it split up the family. The Guardian understands the government has given a commitment not to separate family members. The family has been held in immigration detention since March of last year when ABF officers raided their home in Biloela at dawn, the morning after Priya’s bridging visa expired. She still had legal avenues of appeal open to her at that point. Doctors and Victoria’s commissioner for children and young people – the family has been held in detention in Melbourne – have warned that the prolonged detention and uncertainty has harmed the health of the children. Despite mounting community pressure, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, is refusing to grant the family permission to stay. “I would like the family to accept that they are not refugees, they’re not owed protection by our country,” he told the Nine Network on Friday. Dutton said the deportation had been years in the making and should surprise no one, least of all the couple who had been warned prior to having children that they would not be allowed to stay. Friends in Biloela say the town has swung from grief and despair when the family was issued their deportation notice on Thursday, to anger at what they see as an unjust failure to consider the family’s circumstance, and the contribution they have made to their community in Biloela. Family friend and advocate Angela Fredericks said she hoped the government might reconsider its position before the next court date Wednesday. “We implore them to do some soul-searching. This should be showing what Australia is made of.” A nationwide day of protest has been planned for Sunday, with rallies in Biloela, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth. The lawyer representing the family, Carina Ford, said she was notified by email overnight that the family had been moved. “This is a concern as it does not give us access to our client in a manner that we would have in a major city nor are we able to facilitate the witnessing of documents,” she said. “It’s also isolating for the family and traumatic for them.” Aran Mylvaganam from the Tamil Refugee Council said the family was deeply traumatised by being moved in secret, their isolation and the uncertainty over their future. “The children are constantly crying,” he said. “Kopika is feeling very lonely. “As members of the Tamil community, it’s really heartbreaking to see our people being treated this way by our government. They came to this country just to find a safer place. Sri Lanka is a dangerous country for Tamils. Priya and Nades fled the country under dangerous circumstances.”",2019-08-31 05:29:01,83010
australia-news/2021/sep/29/climate-pressure-on-scott-morrison-grows-after-nsw-promises-to-cut-emissions-in-half-by-2030,Australia news,Climate pressure on Scott Morrison grows as NSW promises to cut emissions in half by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/29/climate-pressure-on-scott-morrison-grows-after-nsw-promises-to-cut-emissions-in-half-by-2030,"Scott Morrison faces escalating pressure to set a more ambitious national climate target for 2030 after the New South Wales Coalition state government promised to cut the state’s emissions in half this decade. The commitment by Australia’s largest state is backed by Liberals and Nationals in cabinet while their federal counterparts remain publicly split on climate policy. The new target lifts its 2030 emissions reduction target from 35% to 50% compared with 2005 levels.
In a pointed contrast with the language used by some federal MPs, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said increasing the target showed the state was “serious about setting itself up for the future and helping the world decarbonise”. John Barilaro, the Nationals leader and deputy premier, said it would be good for regional communities, which would reap the rewards of new clean industries. They said updated projections to be released on Wednesday suggested the state could attract $37bn in private investment while meeting the goal. “This is about putting the policies in place to give industry and investors certainty, not only to protect our planet but to future-proof our prosperity and way of life,” Berejiklian said. The state commitment will add to the domestic and international pressure on Morrison to set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and significantly increase Australia’s short-term goal before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. The existing 2030 target – a 26-28% cut – was set six years ago, and has been widely criticised as not consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd predicted the Morrison government would be forced to change direction and nearly double Australia’s emissions target for 2030 to avoid international isolation. Rudd said he believed Morrison had begun a “massive crabwalk” on climate, pointing to the prime minister’s shift to saying Australia would reach net zero “preferably” by 2050 and reportedly discussing with News Corp some of its newspapers backing that target before Cop26.
He said he believed the next step would be the government increasing its 2030 emissions reduction target to “about 50%”. “He knows that if he doesn’t do that, he’s going to be left completely internationally isolated by everybody,” Rudd said, citing what he called “the real risk” of the European Union imposing a carbon tariff on Australian exports. “Anything less than a target to halve emissions by 2030 risks the Great Barrier Reef disappearing and won’t be seen as credible by the international community. That’s what the independent Climate Change Authority said is our fair share of the global effort to tackle the climate crisis. And that’s what the Americans are doing.” Rudd said a net zero commitment that deferred “the heavy lifting” until after 2030 “won’t be worth the paper it is written on”. In recognition of growing concern about climate policy on the Liberal backbench, Morrison met on Tuesday with moderate MPs concerned the government may not set a 2050 net zero target to appease opponents in the National party. He told the group he hoped to release a roadmap explaining how the country could meet net zero emissions and to formally adopt a 2050 target, but he had not yet reached agreement with the Nationals. Barilaro said the Nationals supported the new 2030 state target because regional NSW was “home to the skills, infrastructure and resources needed” as demand for low emissions technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, grew. “We will continue to take action in a way that delivers more jobs and more investment for people in the city and in the bush,” he said.

NSW’s push to meet the target will be underpinned by clean energy legislation passed with multi-party support last year. Matt Kean, the NSW energy and environment minister and a regular critic of the Morrison government on climate, said peer-reviewed modelling found the state’s emissions were projected to fall between 47% and 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Kean said as global demand for low carbon products and investments grew the state’s fortunes would be increasingly “tied to the fortunes of our planet”. “International capital is looking for safe havens and trying to avoid carbon risk,” he said. “If [market participants] don’t feel that a state or jurisdiction has the right targets and policies in place, people will not invest. “When you are competing for scarce capital against Europe, against Japan, against countries that have strong targets and plans, [not acting] will come at a cost to mums and dads on their mortgages, and small business owners. The cost will flow through the whole economy.” ‘The world will decarbonise’ The political shift came as the think tank Beyond Zero Emissions released a report that found Australia could develop green exports worth nearly triple the value of existing fossil fuel industries, but needed to act soon to avoid missing the opportunity. It suggested surging global demand for zero-carbon products including green steel, renewably generated hydrogen and ammonia, green aluminium and critical minerals could be worth $333bn a year to the Australian economy by 2050. Heidi Lee, Beyond Zero Emissions’ chief executive, said other nations would capture “early market share” and Australia would be left behind if it did not invest in clean exports soon.
The report said 39% of Australia’s current commodity exports were fossil fuels – mainly thermal and metallurgical coal, crude oil and liquified natural gas. The bulk of these were sold to Japan, South Korea and China, which each had net zero targets for 2050 or 2060. That suggested the value of Australia’s exports would fall by $128bn a year unless it invested in alternatives. “In the three decades leading to 2050, the world will decarbonise,” Lee said. “Australia can choose to become a green export powerhouse and re-industrialise the nation or miss our chance by not acting today.” The group made several recommendations for the country to capitalise on future export opportunities, including setting a $100bn national green export target for 2035, making green export investment a priority for Australian government departments and agencies, creating a $20bn “supergrid deployment authority” with a remit to back large-scale clean investments and launch a five-year national rollout of renewable energy industrial precincts in 14 regional areas.",2021-09-28 14:01:24,131224
politics/2022/jun/25/boris-johnson-carrie-johnson-150000-treehouse-for-son-at-chequers,Politics,"Boris Johnson wanted £150,000 treehouse at Chequers, say reports",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/25/boris-johnson-carrie-johnson-150000-treehouse-for-son-at-chequers,"Boris Johnson planned to build a £150,000 treehouse for his son at Chequers but was stopped when police raised security concerns, it has been reported. The prime minister and his wife, Carrie Johnson, wanted to install the structure during autumn 2020, according to a report in the Times. But they were forced to scrap the plans for the treehouse – which would have been built using expensive bulletproof glass – due to concerns it would be visible from the roadside, it has been claimed. It is understood there were discussions about the project being funded by David Brownlow, a Tory donor, and that designs had been prepared. The proposals were cancelled after Johnson’s close protection officers raised security concerns. However, Downing Street sources claimed the prime minister was also warned about the optics of spending £150,000 on a treehouse. It was far from certain whether permission would have been granted by the Chequers Trust, the body that runs the Buckinghamshire manor house, due to the number of protected trees surrounding Chequers.
Johnson refused to comment on the claims in an interview with journalists travelling with him in Rwanda, where he is attending a Commonwealth leaders summit. He said: “I’m not going to comment on non-existent objects or non-existent jobs to do with my family,” he said. A government spokesperson said there was currently no treehouse at Chequers, nor were there any plans for one to be built in the future. They added: “We do not comment on private or family matters which do not involve any ministerial declarations or taxpayer funds.”
It is not the first time the prime minister and his wife’s home improvement plans have caused controversy. Fresh from his landslide election win in December 2019, the couple pressed ahead with renovating the residence they inherited from Theresa and Philip May. The renovation, under the high-end designer Lulu Lytle, cost at least £112,000, and included gold-coloured wallpaper and fittings. The Electoral Commission opened an investigation into whether a £52,000 donation from Lord Brownlow’s company, Huntswood Associates Ltd, had been declared properly. It concluded the donation was not declared properly and fined the party £17,000. Johnson later repaid the money.",2022-06-25 12:15:05,149033
society/2021/apr/26/volunteers-hired-for-clinical-trial-of-covid-vaccine-made-in-scotland-valneva,Society,Volunteers hired for clinical trial of Covid vaccine made in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/26/volunteers-hired-for-clinical-trial-of-covid-vaccine-made-in-scotland-valneva,"Researchers are recruiting thousands of UK volunteers for the final stage clinical trial of a candidate coronavirus vaccine that is being manufactured in Scotland. Doctors plan to give the Valneva vaccine to 4,000 adults from the beginning of May in a phase 2/3 trial that will run from more than 20 sites across England and two hospitals in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The move follows promising early stage trial results, which found that two shots of the vaccine produced a good immune response without raising safety concerns. If it performs well in the new trial, Valneva hopes to seek approval as soon as the summer, paving the way for potential booster shots this autumn. More than half the UK population has received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. The rollout includes shots from Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna, but adding further vaccines to Britain’s armoury will boost resilience against any manufacturing and supply glitches and the risk that some vaccines may fail against new variants. “You want several tools in your toolbox in case you have problems,” said Prof Adam Finn, a paediatrician at Bristol University and chief investigator on the Valneva trial. “You want to have not just a number of vaccines, but a number of vaccines that employ different approaches.”
The French company’s vaccine is being produced for the UK in Livingston, West Lothian. Encouraged by early trial data, the government recently upped its original order from 60m to 100m doses, matching the number of shots on order for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Valneva said it could manufacture up to a further 150m shots for the rest of the world. Valneva’s vaccine is based on a more traditional technology than those now being rolled out in Britain. It uses an inactivated coronavirus virus to stimulate the immune system, an approach developed more than 50 years ago for polio and which is used in flu, rabies and hepatitis A vaccines. Because the vaccine incorporates the whole virus, rather than only the surface spike protein, it may produce broader protection against the disease and worrisome variants that have mutations in the spike protein. The 13-month trial will assess whether the Valneva vaccine produces more neutralising antibodies against the coronavirus than the AstraZeneca shot. Researchers aim to recruit 1,000 people aged 18 to 29 who will receive the Valneva vaccine, and 3,000 older adults who will receive either Valneva or AstraZeneca.
All participants will receive two shots of vaccine four weeks apart. For those aged 30 and above, neither they nor their doctors will know which vaccine they have received during the course of the trial. After both shots have been given, researchers expect those taking part to have four or five follow-up visits for blood and saliva tests. The Valneva vaccine is the only whole virus, inactivated and adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials in Europe. An adjuvant is an ingredient that helps to create a stronger immune response. While the trial is open to older adults, the vast majority of over-50s in the UK have already been offered a vaccine. More data on older individuals will be gathered from a parallel trial in Australia. “If we don’t slip in any way and keep on track, we want to get this to the regulators in the summer so that we have the vaccine available in the autumn if we need it,” said Finn.
Many manufacturers have started work on second-generation jabs to target new variants of the virus that appear to be partially resistant to the vaccines being rolled out around the world. The UK vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, told MPs in February that the Valneva vaccine could serve as an effective booster in the autumn because it used an approach thought to be more effective against mutants. Further work this year will assess the safety of using Valneva as a booster in people who have already received shots of other vaccines.",2021-04-25 23:01:20,122280
football/2021/may/31/viacomcbs-deal-points-to-brighter-future-for-a-league-and-w-league,Football,Broadcast deal points to brighter future for A-League and W-League | Jonathan Howcroft,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/31/viacomcbs-deal-points-to-brighter-future-for-a-league-and-w-league,"The revolution will be televised. Last week’s announcement of a five-year $200m broadcast partnership with ViacomCBS (owners of Network 10) represents the light at the end of the tunnel for the A-League and W-League. After years of off-field squabbling and existential crises Australian professional football can once again focus on the future. That $200m figure is well below the previous six-year $346m deal with Fox Sports – a reflection of both the changing marketplace in broadcast rights and the declining status of the A-League – but it is at the upper end of expectations and sufficient to underpin the professional game in the short term.
At the very least, the A-League will receive one Saturday primetime fixture per week on 10 supported by a pregame show, with the W-League broadcast live on 10 Bold on a Sunday. But the most interesting elements of the deal sit below the headline figure. A sizeable component of ViacomCBS’s commitment will be delivered as contra. That means the A-League and W-League should be more visible than at any time since the early days of Western Sydney Wanderers almost a decade ago. This will include long sought after advertising spend, as well as the integration of football within Network 10 programming. For example, on the night of the announcement, Jenna McCormick and Michael Zullo were guests on The Project. That should be just the start of a process introducing Australian footballers to a wider audience and increasing awareness and familiarity with the game’s characters. It is an unprecedented opportunity to embed the game in the mainstream with an invested partner. That investment is more than simply contractual. ViacomCBS has purchased a minor equity stake in Australian Professional Leagues (the body responsible for the A-League and W-League since the unbundling from Football Australia), further incentivising the success of the partnership and encouraging longer-term thinking. The equity stake also foreshadows further venture capital investment in the APL. Before the start of next season it is hoped at least $100m more will be added to the game’s coffers, providing league bosses with a rare war chest to aid the reboot.
While all of this is good news for A-League supporters, there are downsides, not least the requirement to sign up to yet another streaming platform to access content. The opening offer is $8.99 per month for the Paramount+ service that unlocks access to every A-League and W-League fixture, but it is implausible that more attractive terms will not be offered to club members. Nonetheless, that still means another login, and with Optus Sport and Kayo still retaining high profile football and Amazon Prime seen as frontrunner to secure the rights to the Socceroos and Matildas, confusion and expense for consumers is only likely to increase.
There is also the probability the A-League will revert to a summer competition, a decision that won’t please everyone, including FA chief executive James Johnson. “Playing in 40-degree heat doesn’t help the product. Playing in the winter does,” he said last year. How the governing bodies navigate this difference of opinion will be a test case for their long-term working relationship. Attention has already turned to how Network 10 will present its coverage. Without the legacy responsibilities that may have dictated decisions at SBS or Fox, 10 has an opportunity to rewrite the script. It earned plaudits for its novel treatment of cricket’s Big Bash League in its early incarnation and it must be hoped it is afforded a similar mandate to be creative and distinctive. It would be a missed opportunity if A-League 2.0 was a facsimile of the original.
Beverley McGarvey, chief content officer of ViacomCBS, has spoken of the importance of authenticity, citing The Project as an example. Of the show’s panelists, she told CEO Magazine, “they speak with an authentic voice and they believe what they’re saying. They need the flexibility and room to do that, and I think that’s how we produce our shows.” The pregame show, and any other non-match football content throughout the network, will be especially important. It is a devilishly difficult task producing material that appeals to Australian football’s myriad and vocal communities, but finding the game’s voice (or voices) will be integral to the venture’s success. This challenge is magnified by operating as the sole broadcaster. Previously, Fox and SBS were able to distinguish themselves in contrast to one another, 10 will not have that luxury. The network’s viewership leans towards a younger and more female audience, which is likely to inform decision making. Professional football in Australia has endured some lean years. The pandemic turned malaise into panic. The announcement of a new broadcast partner is the first step out of a dark hole and hopefully towards a brighter future.",2021-05-30 17:30:01,123258
world/2022/apr/24/british-antarctic-territory-to-hold-its-first-same-sex-wedding,World news,British Antarctic Territory to hold its first same-sex wedding,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/british-antarctic-territory-to-hold-its-first-same-sex-wedding,"Two polar research ship crew members are to become the first same-sex couple to get married in the British Antarctic Territory. Eric Bourne and Stephen Carpenter hope to tie the knot on Monday, although it may be pushed back because of the weather. Bourne and Carpenter have been together for 20 years. They work on the Royal Research Ship Sir David Attenborough, one of the most advanced polar research ships in the world and one which that came perilously and unforgettably close to being called RSS Boaty McBoatface. The wedding will be performed by the boat’s captain, Will Whatley, at the British Antarctic Survey’s main research station at Rothera on Adelaide Island, a place shared with numerous Adélie penguins and Weddell seals. The pair are experienced seafarers and have travelled the world together on a variety of ships. Carpenter said: “Antarctica is such an incredible place. We have been together for 20 years but now we’ve both been to Antarctica together, it felt like the perfect place for us to finally tie the knot! We’ve even had the coordinates of the wedding location engraved into our rings.” Bourne said they were both very proud to be the first. “BAS is such a welcoming and accepting employer, and we feel very lucky to be able to live and work in such an incredible community and place together.” The BAS said the couple’s big day “will mark a historic step for diversity and inclusion in polar science”.
The marriage will be registered with the British Antarctic Territory (BAT) government, based in the Foreign Office, and the marriage will be valid in the UK. It is the second marriage to take place between BAS staff since BAT law was changed in 2016 to make such events easier. The ceremony is due to be attended by the 30 crew of the RRS Sir David Attenborough, followed by a reception with about 100 staff from the research station. Food will be prepared by the station’s chef, and the facility’s resident band will provide the music. The RRS Sir David Attenborough is a £200m research ship that is part of a mission investigating whether warm waters are melting the glaciers and ice shelves of the Antarctic from below. It has a unique “moon pool”, a 4 sq metre vertical shaft that goes right through the ship. The boat was launched on the Mersey at Birkenhead in 2018 by Attenborough himself, who said the naming was the “greatest of honours”. Before the boat’s launch a public poll was held to decide a name. More than 32,000 names were put forward including “It’s Bloody Cold Here”, “I Like Big Boats & I Cannot Lie” and “What Iceberg?”.
Particularly striking was the name Boaty McBoatface, suggested by the former BBC radio presenter James Hand. It gained 124,109 votes and 33% of the total vote, the biggest number by far. But given that the boat is “a serious science ship that required the name of a serious scientist”, the vote was overruled. Instead, a small but very advanced yellow submarine on the Sir David Attenborough carries the name Boaty McBoatface. The weather forecast for Rothera on Monday is a bracing -2C (28F), and it will feel like -7C, the Met Office said. The couple said they were planning a second celebration for family and friends, this time in Spain.",2022-04-24 17:05:39,145371
sport/2020/dec/21/talking-horses-doyle-takes-third-but-is-big-winner-after-stellar-year,Sport,Talking Horses: Doyle takes third but is big winner after stellar year,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/21/talking-horses-doyle-takes-third-but-is-big-winner-after-stellar-year,"Hollie Doyle had to settle for a place in the frame at the Sports Personality of the Year Awards , but in some respects she was still the biggest winner of the night, both in terms of raising her public and professional profile, and also on behalf of the sport and industry she represents. Doyle, 24, is possibly the only person in Britain who does not want 2020 to end. It is just her latest achievement, among so many over the past few months, to have got within a length or two of winning such a prestigious award at such an early stage of her career.
Ten years ago, when Tony McCoy became the first Spoty winner from racing, he was firmly established as the most successful jockey in National Hunt history. McCoy also made the podium twice, in third place, in 2002 and 2013 . And even when Frankie Dettori rode all seven winners at Ascot on QEII day, it was only enough to get him to the same third place at Spoty. Doyle, by contrast, is at a very different point in her career path, and should still have the best and most productive seasons of her career ahead. Her headline-grabbing achievements have tended to fall into one of two categories. Some are related to her gender. She set a record (beating her own mark from 2019) for winners in a year for a female jockey, which is all the more remarkable given that the campaign lost two and a half months to lockdown. She was also the first woman to ride five winners on a single card.
The more significant milestones, though, have been those that chart the progress of any jockey, male or female, including several that many riders never reach. There was a first winner at Royal Ascot in June, a first Group Two winner the following month and then, on Champions Day in October, Doyle’s first Group One victory – something the overwhelming majority of riders never get to celebrate. More recently, her first ride at the Breeders’ Cup in the United States was followed a few weeks later by a first winner in Hong Kong. She is a hugely talented, highly successful young jockey who just happens to be female, and edging ever closer to the tiny elite of Flat jockeys who carve up the majority of the biggest races between themselves. Of the 71 Group One races in Britain since the start of 2019, 54% have been won by four riders: Frankie Dettori (17), Ryan Moore (eight), Jim Crowley (seven) and Oisin Murphy ( six). William Buick, the most successful of Godolphin’s principal jockeys, has five. At this stage in their careers, all that the leading talents in the next generation of jockeys – including Doyle and her partner, Tom Marquand – can do is to ensure that they are up for consideration if or when one of the big jobs becomes available. And the best way for a rider just outside the elite to maintain and boost their profile is to launch a serious challenge for the Flat jockeys’ championship. Murphy (5-4) and Buick (2-1) head the market but Marquand (6-1) and Doyle (10-1) are next in the list and perfectly poised to give it their best shot. What a months-long win for racing that could be. A close title race involving Doyle and quite possibly Marquand too would be a promotional godsend for a sport that has lost hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue to the pandemic. Simply by standing alongside the other shortlisted contenders, Doyle has planted a seed of recognition in the public consciousness. If it continues to grow, the benefit for racing could be incalculable. Monday’s best bets Doyle has never been the type to rest on her laurels and so she will swap the glamour of the Spoty podium for a book of five rides at a wet and windy Lingfield, with hopes of at least one winner but nothing even vaguely in the “banker” category. Araifjan is arguably her best chance in the sprint handicap but Robert Cowell’s gelding is up against a strong opponent in Tin Hat (2.05). Doyle was in the saddle when Tin Hat ran third at 40-1 over seven furlongs at Lingfield 19 days ago, his first start since mid-July, but Georgia Dobie takes over as he drops back to six and takes a handy 5lb off his back. Smokey (3.05) has had a busy year with 12 runs including a hat-trick in September and October. He has made the frame in three runs since, beaten less than a length each time, and looks a big price at around 8-1 to get his head back in front.
Musselburgh has a competitive jumps card with Overcourt (2.45) an obvious bet at around 11-10 to go one better than on his seasonal and chasing debut at Sedgefield in October. Definite Wisdom (1.15) and Barnay (2.15) are also fairly priced on the same card, while Rockley Point (4.55) catches the eye at around 13-2 for Newcastle’s all-weather meeting.",2020-12-21 10:23:00,115100
australia-news/2021/dec/23/unethical-doctors-condemn-nsw-government-for-considering-charging-unvaccinated-patients-for-covid-care,Australia news,‘Unethical’: doctors condemn NSW government for considering charging unvaccinated patients for Covid care,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/unethical-doctors-condemn-nsw-government-for-considering-charging-unvaccinated-patients-for-covid-care,"Australia’s peak doctors body has criticised an “unethical” proposal to charge unvaccinated people for their medical care that is being considered by the New South Wales government. The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed the government was looking at forcing people who had not received the jab to pay for their medical bills if they required hospital treatment for Covid. “This is an option under consideration by the NSW government,” Hazzard said in a statement on Wednesday evening after it was first reported by Sydney radio station 2GB.
The health minister did not provide any further details about how such a plan would work and did not respond to further questions. The idea represents a radical departure from Australia’s system of universal healthcare and has attracted fierce criticism. The Australian Medical Association president, Dr Omar Khorshid, labelled the proposal “unethical”. “The big issue from a medical point of view is that it’s really not ethical or the right thing to do to limit access to healthcare based on people’s previous health choices,” he told Guardian Australia. “If you follow that same logic, are you going to ask smokers to pay for their healthcare? “I think it would be a real shame if through this pandemic we lose our compassion, we lose our humanity, and our care for fellow Australians, even if they’ve made choices we think are unwise or incorrect or even completely antisocial.” Khorshid said he was unsure whether such a proposal would be legal or if it would violate the National Health Reform Agreement, struck between the states and the commonwealth, through which public hospital funding flows. “Any change to that would be a very substantial change to our public hospitals,” he said. He also questioned how it could be enforced given the cost of an ICU admission for Covid-19 was “astronomical” and there was “no way” the average Australian would have any way of paying the bill. In NSW, 93.4% of residents aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated, but the majority of people in intensive care are unvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospital in NSW has nearly doubled over the past week. On Wednesday, there were 302 people in hospital with the virus, including 40 in the ICU, and 12 who required ventilation. In November, former NSW premier Bob Carr called for Australia to follow Singapore’s example after its government announced it would start charging people who were “unvaccinated by choice” for their medical bills.
At the time, Scott Morrison said it was a “heavy-handed approach” that he did not support. “We don’t have a mandatory vaccination policy as a federal government, that’s not something that we’ve done,” he told 7News. “We live in a country where we’re not going around demonising those who want to make their own choices, I think that’s very important.”",2021-12-22 16:30:31,137817
world/2022/apr/23/motivated-but-outgunned-ukrainian-soldiers-discuss-life-on-the-southern-front,World news,Motivated but outgunned: Ukrainian soldiers discuss life on the southern front,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/motivated-but-outgunned-ukrainian-soldiers-discuss-life-on-the-southern-front,"A group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers stood in a warehouse in south-western Ukraine when they were shelled by Russian artillery. Serhiy was hit in the face with shrapnel. He and his recent best friend Hennadiy took a selfie clutching part of the shell which did not hit them. Moments later, Russian tanks appeared on a hill opposite and fired across the village in front of them, including at the warehouse. Hennadiy and the rest of the group – all natives of the Zaporizhzhia region – were also hit by shrapnel and all of them suffered hearing damage. “They had three tanks on the hill and they were just shooting down at us. We just had rifles,” said Hennadiy. “We had some equipment that the Americans and Poles gave us, but it wasn’t enough to fight.” They said they escaped from the warehouse under plumes of smoke and walked to the next village, from where they were taken to the Zaporizhzhia military hospital.
The Guardian was granted access to the military hospital to speak to soldiers on the condition that reporters not identify specific locations of battles or publish the full names of soldiers interviewed. “There are plenty of people motivated to fight,” said Serhiy, speaking from a hospital ward with the rest of the company who escaped from the warehouse. “But we are underarmed and desperately trying to hold the whole mass [of the Russian army].” “There’s also just not enough time to train everyone who wants to fight,” added Dmytro, another member of the company, who was lying on a bed in the ward. Ukraine has criticised the west for dripfeeding it arms, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealing almost daily because his country cannot manufacture the weapons or ammunition it needs to fight off the Russian invaders. Equipment demanded has ranged from fighter jets and tanks, which the west has been reluctant or slow to supply, through to artillery and armoured vehicles – and most simply of all guns and ammunition. On Thursday the US said it would supply another $800m (£620m) worth of arms, including 72 howitzers, taking the total value of its arms supply to more than $3bn since the war began, including “more than 50m rounds of ammunition” according to the US president, Joe Biden. However, even when weapons are supplied it can take a fortnight or more before they arrive in Ukraine. Other major countries have been slower or more reluctant, most notably Germany, which has scaled back the heavy weapons it is prepared to offer Ukraine and whose chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has admitted that the stockpiles of what it is prepared to send are running short. The speed at which Ukraine’s forces are using arms and ammunition has also surprised the west, which has begun to ramp up industrial production in an attempt to help Kyiv hold out. Ukrainian forces are currently holding a line which stretches hundreds of miles from Kharkiv in the north-east to outside Mykolaiv in the south-west.
Serhiy, whose face was cut up by the shrapnel, was happy to have his picture taken despite the risks, as pointed out to him by a military press secretary, were he to be captured by Russian forces. “We’re not afraid of anything,” said Serhiy. The Guardian confirmed once more before publication that permission was granted to use the soldiers’ images. Earlier that day, the group had avoided fire from a Russian plane. “A plane came over us and bombed us a little bit. It was a bit unpleasant,” said Serhiy, with a smile. “Well, actually, not a bit, utterly unpleasant.” Another member of the group who escaped from the warehouse, Mykola, said the Russians had drones and knew exactly where their positions were. “Things are very hard,” said Mykola. “I can only speak for our situation. I don’t know what it’s like for the other [battalions].” Out of all the cities in central and eastern Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia city feels like the one where life is closest to how it was pre-war, but Russian forces occupy more than 70% of Zaporizhzhia region. Twenty per cent of the region meanwhile makes up Ukraine’s southern front, and is a battle zone between Russian and Ukrainian forces. New restrictions placed on movements of journalists south of Zaporizhzhia city seem to indicate that the situation on the southern front is worsening. According to soldiers interviewed by the Guardian, Ukrainian forces were pushed out of at least one of the three towns and villages an hour south of the city that the New York Times visited three weeks ago. The military press secretary for Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Ariefiev, said journalists were not allowed to travel to those places now, but said that this was not because the situation on the front was worsening. He said the travel restrictions were because the active phase of the war on the southern front had begun. A group of soldiers the Guardian visited in Zaporizhzhia region were around seven miles (12km) from Russian positions. They did not expect the fighting to reach them quickly and said that the lines further south would hold – though shells were landing between two and three miles away.
They said they lacked medical equipment. Between 23 people, they had just six helmets and six tourniquets – some of them hand-sewn by civilian volunteers. They said that while the helmets were on their way from Poland, volunteers and suppliers were struggling to find tourniquets even abroad. The injured soldiers back in the hospital said they received an overwhelmingly warm welcome from local villagers, who often bought them food. On their retreat, they took the number plates off the cars they used so that the Russian soldiers would not be able to identify locals who lent them vehicles. There have been widespread reports of local residents suspected of aiding the Ukrainian army being tortured and even killed by Russian forces. Serhiy said he used his own car to get around the battlefield for just under two months before being injured and abandoning it. “I’ll never get [the car] back,” said Serhiy. “Although maybe it will return to me itself.”",2022-04-23 05:00:44,145679
australia-news/2022/may/30/trent-zimmerman-says-liberals-should-embrace-labors-climate-policy,Australia news,Trent Zimmerman says Liberals should embrace Labor’s climate policy ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/30/trent-zimmerman-says-liberals-should-embrace-labors-climate-policy,"The outgoing Liberal moderate Trent Zimmerman says his former colleagues should embrace Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target if the Coalition wants to win back the Liberal party’s progressive heartland at the next federal election. Zimmerman, a prominent moderate, lost his seat on 21 May to the teal independent Kylea Tink. On Monday he told the ABC that if the incoming Liberal leadership wanted to win back electorates like North Sydney, or other seats where the government’s record on climate change was a problem, having a “sensible approach” needed to be at the top of the list. Rather than launch a new round of the climate wars in the new parliament, he said, the Coalition should accept the Labor party had a mandate for its 2030 emissions reduction target of 43%. That was “an easy step the opposition could take”.
He said the National party also needed to accept the imperative of emissions reduction if it wanted the Liberal party to be able to win sufficient seats in the major cities to be able to form majority government. When the Queensland National Matt Canavan declared during the campaign that the government’s net zero target by 2050 was “dead”, that was “one of the killer moments for us”, Zimmerman said. “There’s a whole package of reasons as to why we lost inner-city seats like mine and clearly climate change was one of the key issues,” he said. “The fact the National party leadership and individual members were seen to not be genuinely enthusiastic about our net zero commitment.” Resistance to climate action from Nationals and Liberal rightwingers “undoubtably had an impact”. While some of the departing Liberals have pointed the finger at Scott Morrison, believing the former prime minister was a drag on their campaigns because of his unpopularity with centre-right metropolitan progressives, Zimmerman said the Liberal party should not delude itself that the 2022 election was lost because the frontman was unpopular. “Blaming an individual may mean we don’t learn the lessons that need to be learned,” Zimmerman said. He said the Coalition lost a substantial number of seats in the city and copped significant anti-government swings in some regional contests because voters did not like the former government’s policy offering. Women were unhappy with the former government and a number of voters were also angry Morrison didn’t follow through with his promise to legislate a national anti-corruption body, he said. The Liberal party lost six heartland seats to climate-focused independents on 21 May, including Kooyong, which was held by the former treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and a host of other inner-city seats including Higgins, Reid and Bennelong.
The Liberal party is expected to instal the Queensland rightwinger Peter Dutton as its new leader on Monday. Zimmerman said Dutton had “a pragmatic streak” and he would need that quality to reboot the Coalition’s battered electoral fortunes. Some rightwingers want the Coalition to move further to the right and target Labor’s outer suburban and regional blue-collar territories, effectively writing off its own progressive seats in the cities. Zimmerman said on Monday he had disagreed with Dutton’s stance on some policy issues but the new leader would be fully aware the party had to “regain the trust of voters in electorates like mine” to plot a pathway to victory in 2025. “I think it’s important he’s a constructive opposition leader,” the former MP said.",2022-05-30 00:31:48,146399
world/2022/feb/26/russian-forces-advance-inside-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far,World news,Russian forces advance inside Ukraine: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/russian-forces-advance-inside-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far,"Russian troops pressed towards Ukraine’s capital on Saturday after a night of explosions and street fighting that sent Kyiv residents seeking shelter underground. The death toll so far in the Russian invasion of Ukraine is at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry. Three children are among those dead. The ministry’s head was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying 1,115 people had been injured, including 33 children. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at press briefing that his country would triumph over Russian forces. He said Ukrainian forces controlled Kyiv and key areas, adding: “We are defending our land and the future of our children.”
More European countries are in favour of cutting Russia out of the Swift global payments system, Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, have said. France supported the move, said Kuleba, while the Cypriot finance minister said his country was not opposed. In Italy, the leader of PD, a main coalition party, said Rome would support a block. Germany is in talks over approving the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by a third country but a decision has not been taken yet. Russia now has at least 50% of its invasion force inside Ukraine but is making slow progress due to unexpectedly stiff resistance, a senior US defence official has said. The official said that the Russian military had still not taken control of any Ukraine city, nor has it gained air superiority over the country, and the US had “indications that the Russians are increasingly frustrated by their lack of momentum over the last 24 hours.” Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, said Russia could cut diplomatic ties with the west. The Russian RIA news agency reported that the senior lawmaker Andrei Klimov said Russia would decide in which areas it would work with the west and where it no longer made sense to cooperate. A Russian shell has hit a residential building in the centre of Kyiv, Ukraine says. Video shared by Zelenskiy’s press service shows the missile exploding in a private flat, sending smoke and debris into the living room.
Russia’s communications regulator has ordered independent media to remove reports describing Moscow’s attack on Ukraine as an “assault, invasion, or declaration of war” or face being blocked and fined. It accused a number of outlets of spreading “unreliable socially significant untrue information” about the shelling of Ukrainian cities by the Russian army and civilian deaths. The UN refugee agency said that nearly 120,000 people have so far fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries to escape the Russian invasion. The agency expects that up to 4 million Ukrainians could flee if the situation deteriorates further. Many Ukrainians have been preparing to fight. City authorities urged residents to stay home and prepare molotov cocktails for a citizen uprising against Russian fighters if they break through defensive lines. In one district, rifles were handed out to any citizen who wanted to fight, and the defence ministry has opened the army to any Ukrainian citizen. Joe Biden has released $350m in military aid to Ukraine. In a memorandum to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350m allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine’s defence.
Vladimir Putin on Friday urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people”. Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chatshow hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with political dissent. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India and UAE), and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”.",2022-02-26 16:20:27,140744
music/2022/may/24/the-return-of-propaganda-susanne-freytag-claudia-brucken-ztt,Music,‘We were a different side of the 80s. Not the Duran Duran 80s’: the return of Propaganda ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/24/the-return-of-propaganda-susanne-freytag-claudia-brucken-ztt,"In early 1983, a Düsseldorf band called Propaganda got a message: Trevor Horn wanted them to come to London. It was an enticing and deeply improbable turn of events. Horn was the UK’s hottest pop producer, a man who had unexpectedly turned the hopelessly drippy duo Dollar into a critical cause célèbre and piloted ABC’s debut The Lexicon of Love to platinum-selling transatlantic success, also making it the fourth biggest-selling album of 1982 in the UK. Propaganda, however, were no one’s idea of a pop band. They were electronic experimentalists, a product of Germany’s burgeoning post-punk Neue Deutsche Welle scene. As vocalist Susanne Freytag puts it, they were attempting: “To go away from American music and find a kind of identity – there was a lot of shame in our generation in Germany, and it was a way of finding, or seeing people using the German language and making new music.” One of their members, Ralf Dörper, had previously been in metal-banging industrialists Die Krupps: he claimed to be less interested in music than he was in film. They had already caused a ripple of controversy in Germany by plundering imagery from the 1920s and 30s: a TV show refused to let them use a film featuring images of Zeppelin airships and Marlene Dietrich because, Dörper later said, “they didn’t understand that we might be questioning values of the past, rather than accepting them”. And they were not huge on melody. One of the songs on their demo tape was a German-language extrapolation of Throbbing Gristle’s entirely tune-free 1981 single Discipline. When the call from Trevor Horn came through, Propaganda scrambled to recruit a new member, Claudia Brücken, on the grounds that none of them could actually sing. “I felt a bit shocked,” says Freytag. “I thought ‘I’m not a singer, I’m happy to go and do something, but oh my God, we need a singer’. She is a very good singer, thank God.”
It was the beginning of one of 80s pop’s most unlikely and enduring stories. Propaganda’s career was brief and turbulent – by 1986, the band had splintered, mired in legal disputes – and they never sold huge quantities of records: their debut album A Secret Wish reached No 16 in the UK. But the people who liked them seemed to love them with a rare intensity. In 2018, when Freytag and Brücken reunited to play A Secret Wish live in London, “people came from Mexico and Japan” to see it. A similar enthusiasm seems to have greeted the news that the pair have made a new album, The Heart Is Strange, with A Secret Wish’s producer Stephen Lipson, under the name xPropaganda. “There’s someone who’s messaged me about coming to the London show from North Carolina,” frowns Lipson, sitting with Brücken and Freytag in a north London recording studio. “He’s bringing his daughter. It’s extraordinary. I don’t understand any of it.” “Maybe,” Freytag suggests, “Propaganda represents a different kind of 80s. It’s not what we associate with … the Duran Duran side of the 80s.” Horn had been alerted to Propaganda by NME journalist Paul Morley, with whom he was starting a new record label, Zang Tuum Tumb. The fact that its name came from futurist artist Filippo Marinetti’s onomatopoeic description of the sound of warfare underscored its leftfield, arty approach to pop, with which Propaganda fitted perfectly. “Paul liked the music, but it was also the combination of the name, the weird Germans and the really hard beat,” says Freytag. “It was a bit mad. Paul and Trevor, they were really intrigued by the thought of what they could make with people like us: four quite experimental, strange Germans. That was also appealing for us.” So Propaganda happily submitted to a ZTT makeover, which involved first Horn, then his deputy Lipson, drastically reworking their sound and Morley decorating their records with impenetrable sleeve notes: one single’s cover featured not one but two lengthy quotes from Italian literary theorist Franco Moretti, the first about Balzac, the second pondering the gender of vampires. “I was experimental – I was very playful with creative things,” says Brücken. “And for me, the opportunity to work with Trevor was amazing, and to work with Stephen and all these fantastic people. I always felt we were doing something together, I didn’t feel like my artistic integrity was at all compromised in any way.”
Under ZTT’s aegis, Propaganda became pop stars, of a sort: within a year, they were on The Tube, performing their German-language extrapolation of Throbbing Gristle’s Discipline to a visibly nonplussed audience. They also performed their debut single, The Nine Lives of Dr Mabuse, which showed what Horn could do with their sound: a sample-stuffed, cutting-edge production with a killer chorus, which still retained the original band’s harsh, experimental edge. One critic memorably called them “Abba in hell”. It made the Top 10 in Germany, meaning Brücken, still at school in Düsseldorf, had to “be excused by my art teacher to go and make a video in Folkestone”. When she returned, bearing the Anton Corbijn-directed, German expressionism-influenced end result, “for my art teacher, it was a total proud moment, because it just dived into German history and the photography was so exquisite”. Its followup, Duel, earned them an appearance on Top of the Pops. By now, work had commenced on their debut album: distracted by the unexpectedly vast success of ZTT’s other signing, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Horn bowed out, letting Lipson take over as producer. It took a year and remains a source of controversy within the band: Lipson says he recently “came unstuck” with the band’s fourth member, Michael Mertens, over precisely who did and wrote what during its making. “I think he thinks the songs were more formed than I think they were, that was the crux of it. I remember there’s a song, Dream Within a Dream, and he just had a chord progression. A beautiful chord progression, and acknowledged as such by one and all, but there was no song, no idea, no structure, and I think quite a lot of the songs were like that.”
The sessions sound deranged, a state of affairs compounded by the fact that ZTT had carelessly neglected to set a budget for the recording. At one point, a percussionist was required to stand on a ladder throwing “huge bits of metal” into a porcelain bath. At another, Lipson and a programmer engaged in a “sample war”, taking turns to blast each other with the most outrageous noises they could find: you can hear it on Jewel. Contributions were solicited from Japan’s David Sylvian and Yes guitarist Steve Howe, the latter dragged in as he walked past the studio. The end result was hugely expensive and wildly inventive, but when Lipson played it to the assembled bigwigs from ZTT’s parent company Island, he says it was greeted with silence, broken only by the plaintive inquiry: “Have you got a single?” A Secret Wish attracted some very high-profile fans: Martin Gore claimed it was a huge influence on Depeche Mode’s subsequent albums, Quincy Jones wanted to licence it for release in the US, and Horn subsequently claimed he had borrowed its sound on Michael Jackson’s Bad. But cracks had started to appear in Propaganda’s ranks, as Freytag remembers: “We did a tour, a lot of TV appearances, and I remember it worked really well, but after that it was a bit like: OK, we didn’t earn enough money and it was a lot of work, and people became frustrated, didn’t really understand this country.” Lipson says that a new manager didn’t help. “We spent a fortune doing [A Secret Wish], but it was so worth doing. The manager wouldn’t see it that way because they hadn’t lived the journey.” Brücken – who married Paul Morley – elected to stay with ZTT, the others left. If nothing else, Propaganda’s split in its aftermath bolstered the mystique of A Secret Wish: its reputation seemed to grow with the passing of time, the vanishing into history of an era when major record labels would bankroll wild experimental follies. There have been various incarnations of Propaganda since, but all attempts to reunite the quartet who made A Secret Wish have floundered, save for a single brief live appearance in 2008. When the most recent attempt to reunite collapsed – “we were working together,” says Freytag diplomatically, “then there was a time when it didn’t really work any more” – Brücken and Freytag struck out on their own as xPropaganda: the plan to write a few new songs with Lipson in order to play live turned into an album.
The irony is that The Heart Is Strange feels exactly like a 21st-century followup to A Secret Wish: not a forensic re-creation of its sound, but a modern album made with the same pop smarts, the same experimental edge, and the same dark undertow, enshrined in songs such as The Wolves Are Returning, a coolly dismayed assessment of the rise of the far right. There’s talk of a followup: an improbable second act to one of the 80s’ most improbable pop stories. “It was just that particular moment in time,” says Brücken, of their first flush of success. “It wouldn’t have happened a year later or a year before, you know – it was just this kind of peculiar series of events that happened that made this moment possible. I mean, if we’d planned it, it never would have happened. I always think that.” • The Heart is Strange is out now on ZTT.

film/2021/nov/23/a-boy-called-christmas-review-family-movie-matt-haig,Film,A Boy Called Christmas review – charming quest gets its Claus in all the family,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/23/a-boy-called-christmas-review-family-movie-matt-haig,"You’d need to have the humbuggiest of hearts not to be charmed, even just a little bit, by this family Christmas movie – lavishly adapted, no expense spared, from a kids’ novel by Matt Haig. It begins in modern-day London, with Maggie Smith as the Mary Poppins-ish great-aunt to a trio of siblings. Their mum has recently died, so no one is feeling festive when Aunt Ruth begins telling them a bedtime story on Christmas Eve. Her fairytale is a Santa Claus origins myth, about a boy called Nikolas (played by delightfully urchin-faced newcomer Henry Lawfull). He lives in a forest in Finland with his poor woodcutter dad (Michiel Huisman). They are so poor that when the dotty king (played by Jim Broadbent with endearing spoiled-child petulance) offers a reward to anyone who can bring hope to the land, Nikolas’s dad goes off in search of Elfhelm, the fabled kingdom of elves.
Enter Kristen Wiig, giving it the full Mrs Twit treatment as child-hating ’orrible Aunt Carlotta, who arrives to look after Nikolas. The unspeakable thing she does to his only toy – a doll carved out of an old turnip – is a genius stroke of kids’ writing. So young Nikolas runs away to find his dad, taking with him his talking pet mouse (voiced by Stephen Merchant). On his adventure, he acquires some dead giveaways as to his future career: a red hat with a white bobble, and a reindeer friend called Blitzen. When he finally catches up with his dad, there are some honest unglossed truths about how parents disappoint their kids – and the film has semi-unsentimental things to say about grief too. Still, above all this is A Christmas Movie, made for audiences from four to 94, little ones watching with nan on Boxing Day in front of the telly, everyone a bit drowsy on Quality Street. Maybe because of that, it feels kid-gloves at times: big-hearted and entertaining, but possibly lacking a little fun or oomph. A lovely warming film, though. • A Boy Called Christmas is released on 26 November in cinemas and on Sky Cinema.",2021-11-23 16:00:20,136031

It has been on an imposing scale and has provided excitement for the Berliners, who have been told about it day by day in the press, wireless, and cinema and have gone out in their thousands to the Reich Sport Field to he whisked around by guides in batches of a hundred, one party treading on the heels of the next, and the whole trailing away as far as the eye could see.
Sport in Europe is in yet another state of transformation, and the crowds and their emotions are part of the new phase. The turn of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th century saw the developments in sport brought about by the onslaught of professionalism. The new onslaught is being made by authoritarian governments who have perceived the political and national uses of sport, and the ultimate changes may be even more profound. In Germany the sporting vocabulary has been enlarged by adjectival agglutinations, such as “air-sport,” “defence-sport,” “terrain-sport,” and a new set of conceptions as foreign to the Anglo-Saxon sportsman of to-day, as the changes wrought by the professional epoch were to the generations preceding him. Brightening the streets Of the publicity value of the German government’s apparatus and the virtually unlimited resources of its purse for the promotion of sport the visitor will soon be convinced. Not only has a magnificent stadium for the holding of the Olympic Games been created on a fine site but the capital itself has been transformed by engineer, architect, mason, and house-painter. If there were any unoccupied hands in the building trade in Berlin during the past year it can only have been on Sundays. The shabbiness of the Friedrichstrasse, which gave it its peculiar and slightly sinister character, has given way to dazzling white stone and rather massive vitreous smartness at its junction with the Unter den Linden, itself transformed, especially at night, by the new lighting scheme. The sport field The Reich Sport Field, where the Games are to be held, has been constructed on the site of a former racecourse – a green oasis in the sandy wastes of Brandenburg to which a good deal of additional turf has been brought from other parts. It has been built to serve the Games this year and will form a political demonstration ground and cultural and athletic centre when the Games are over. Its largest unit is the May field, or parade-ground, adjoining the stadium on its west side. The parade-ground will hold meetings of 250,000 people, with lighting and sound-amplifying arrangements from the stadium and accessory buildings. In a bungalow paradise known as the Olympic Village are housed the athletes of the fifty or so nations participating in the Games. The village is surrounded by steel fencing and is under the control of a Reichswehr commandant. The general public is vigorously excluded. Troops are stationed throughout the whole village, and a sharp watch is kept upon admitted visitors. Even in the quietest spots, the visitor will suddenly encounter a Reichswehr man presenting an informal salute with a mutely interrogative eye. The explanation given for the sharp watch is fear of bomb or incendiary plots by Jews or Jewish agents.
Editorial: the Olympic Games 1 August 1936 To-day the Olympic Games begin a new phase. For some years it has been obvious that they are financially profitable to the country which acts as host, by reason of the money which is spent by competitors and visitors. This year at Berlin for the first time we are to see them confessedly exploited not for the peace of the world, not even for the pride of one nation, but as an advertisement for a political party. The conduct of the Games and their setting are to be a demonstration of the excellence of nazism. Houses in Germany have been whitewashed, and there has been other whitewashing as well. German Jews have been given no chance to fit themselves to represent Germany, but a few selected Jews have been included in German teams for the sake of window-dressing. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Herr Hitler opens the Olympics By EA Montague 3 August 1936 The opening ceremony of the eleventh Olympic Games took place here this afternoon in the stadium at the Reich Sports Field. It was probably the longest ritual that has ever heralded the opening of these Games. It was arranged and carried out with mathematical exactitude by the German Organising Committee, and in the course of it there were moments of beauty and significance which one will remember. There were others – not many of them – when one felt that the strength of German national feeling had a little outgrown discretion, but it was a memorable ceremony, immensely enhanced by the nobility of the great stadium in which it was carried out. Continue reading.
In December 1935, the Manchester Guardian questioned whether Britain should be participating in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, with an editorial concluding ‘the Nazi party has injected the political poison of its antisemitism into the principle of human equality on which the Games are based’. Two articles were published, the first, The Olympic Games in the new Germany: the case against taking part (continuation here), while the second looked at The treatment of Jewish athletes in Germany (and here).",2021-07-28 12:11:02,127588
business/commentisfree/2021/jul/25/the-brisbane-olympic-games-deserve-a-gold-medal-for-hyperbole-when-it-comes-to-economic-benefits,Business,The Brisbane Olympic Games deserve a gold medal for hyperbole when it comes to economic benefits | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2021/jul/25/the-brisbane-olympic-games-deserve-a-gold-medal-for-hyperbole-when-it-comes-to-economic-benefits,"The first race of any Olympics is that of politicians rushing out statements boasting how much they will benefit the economy. Alas Brisbane 2032 is no different. The Queensland government has stated that “KPMG has estimated economic and social benefits at $8.1bn for Queensland and $17.6bn for Australia”. Scott Morrison quickly used the figure as well, telling 4BC radio that “we’re estimating … almost $18bn of economic and social benefits for the country”. He dropped the “social” part in his press conference on Thursday, saying “of course it’s going to be a big economic boost to Australia, some $18bn is the estimate over the course of now and to the Games”. So what are these benefits? The first thing to know is the KPMG report has calculated them over 20 years – from 2022 to 2042. The “social benefits” include the main types, the first of which are “resident benefits”. These are “the intangible benefits to residents of a host city/country associated with legacy, community spirit, prestige and civic pride associated with hosting a Games”. KPMG calculated this benefit via a “willingness to pay” measure. Importantly it didn’t survey people in Queensland about their willingness to pay for such things but instead determined it by “borrowing results” from previous studies done for other host cities. Then there are “health benefits” they estimate will come about due to “increased participation in physical activity across Queensland and the nation” that will lead to “lower risk of chronic disease” and “improved productivity” due to fewer sick days. Who knew an Olympic Games was the most efficient way to improve public health! A study after the Sydney Olympics found that only “a moderate increase in adult sport participation occurred”, and that after the Melbourne Commonwealth Games “there was no evidence to support the proposition that the event boosted adult sports participation in Australia or the host state”. Then finally we have “volunteering benefits”. These are things such as “self-improvement and altruistic value” as well as the hope that there will be “an increased likelihood of future volunteering”. All up these social benefits were “quantified” to be worth “up to $3.5bn for Queensland and up to $9.11bn for Australia” (over 20 years). Yes, more than half of the $18bn figure being thrown around is for things like civic pride, better health due to exercise, and self-improvement from volunteering. It’s like freelancers being told they won’t be paid for their work, but they will benefit from hundreds of dollars’ worth of exposure. Then we have the “economic benefits” – due to increased tourism and building works etc. A study in 2011 found the Sydney Olympics “generated a loss in Australian real private and public consumption in present value terms of $2.1bn. This suggests that the Olympics did not bring the economic stimulus that has been claimed.” Another study found that since 1960 the median overrun of costs for Olympic games is of the order of 120% – ie the costs generally blow to be more than double the initial estimate. Sydney’s costs overran by 90%.
If you can’t view the graph click here Morrison also talked up the claim that the Games will “create around 120,000 new jobs.” This figure as well is over 20 years, and sound less impressive when you consider that by 2042 we are likely to have an extra 6 million more people employed than now. Let’s just hope it is not like the Salt Lake City Olympics which promised 35,000 jobs but delivered “between 4,000 and 7,000” and a report found “the Games had little to no effect on employment after 12 months”. My personal favourite part in the report was the suggestion that there was an economic benefit due to “retained expenditure” from Australians not spending money overseas to attend the Olympic Games. By that measure every Olympic Games not held in Australia has been costing our economy. Look, Olympics Games are fun – attending the Sydney Games were one of my sporting highlights – and the quickest way to start having fun is to laugh whenever you hear a politician attach a dollar amount to how much we are all going to benefit from them.",2021-07-24 20:00:32,128291

australia-news/2021/dec/25/pudding-and-ppe-community-groups-put-covid-safe-christmas-cheer-on-the-menu-for-australians-in-need,Australia news,Pudding and PPE: community groups put Covid-safe Christmas cheer on the menu for Australians in need,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/25/pudding-and-ppe-community-groups-put-covid-safe-christmas-cheer-on-the-menu-for-australians-in-need,"Christmas Day will start early at Sydney’s Wayside Chapel. From about 6am volunteers will be blocking off the street and “rolling out the green carpet”. “We’re going to cover Hughes Street in astroturf and lay down some picnic blankets, appropriately socially distanced spots reserved for our very important guests,” the Kings Cross charity’s chief executive, Pastor Jon Owen, says, adding: “many of whom will be waking up in the gutter that morning.” The Wayside Chapel is among many Australian organisations that will open its doors to those with nowhere else to go on Christmas Day, offering a sense of something that has been particularly hard to grasp over the past two years: togetherness.
Other organisations will hold their massive Christmas lunches as takeaway affairs, albeit still with plenty of colour and movement, but Owen is delighted this year’s street party (or picnic) can go ahead. Last year’s event was cancelled due to Sydney’s Northern Beaches outbreak. “We’ve been told by our governments to go and have a family Christmas,” he says. “This is family Christmas for so many people who are going to wake up with no one else in their lives except us.” But there are still Covid considerations. Despite the many volunteers in isolation, Owen says there are plenty of eager helpers on the “reserves bench” – who will be fully vaccinated and wearing PPE. Covid marshals will be in place as the day rolls through the Christmas chapel service with a street choir, Santa’s visit, and into a lunch “with all the trimmings”. Owen insists that the event is more important than ever. “The common refrain is, ‘I don’t know what would have happened to me if I hadn’t been able to come here today’,” he says. “That’s not said in a flippant way. They look me in the eyes with a sense of depth and clarity. It gives you pause in the midst of all the chaos.” Across Sydney in Ashfield, the Rev Bill Crews will be spending his 50th Christmas Day with the poor and disadvantaged. His foundation’s Christmas lunch will be takeaway – but they’re expecting to pump out as many as 3,000 meals across the day. “People are crying out for community now, we’ve been so isolated,” says Crews. “You see a crowd and you kind of get a bit nervous. There’s going to be this need in all of us to get together.” Wayside Chapel’s message is all about love, and Crews expresses a similar sentiment when talking about the importance of his foundation’s Christmas lunch. The last census found there were 16,427 people across the country without a safe, secure place to sleep at night and Owen notes with distress recent food bank research noting many Australians are experiencing food insecurity. This reality only becomes more stark at Christmas. The Salvation Army said in a report released in 2018 that about 15.5% of Australian adults were likely to contact a charity for help with basic necessities such as food, power or other bills at Christmas. “This is a challenging time of the year for people,” says Chris Middendorp, the manager of client services at Sacred Heart Central in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. The Sacred Heart Mission Christmas lunch has been running about 40 years, says Middendorp and, like Crews’ operation in Sydney, it will be takeaway again this year. The charity is expecting to serve about 400 lunches of roast, or mushroom wellington for vegetarians, and Christmas pudding. Most who will come for lunch will be experiencing homelessness or struggling financially and are local to the area, which is known for its stark economic divide between the wealthy and disadvantaged.
They’ll take their Christmas lunches to the park next door to dine together, or back to rooming houses, or nearby public housing, Middendorp says. “It’s not just about the food of course,” says Middendorp. “A lot of the people we work with are experiencing disadvantage. They don’t have as positive an experience of the community as the rest of us. It’s good to have a place of non-judgment.” Crews has a similar message: “Many come here feeling left out, isolated, not cared for by society. I hope they leave here feeling, ‘I am part of society and I am loved for who I am, just as I am.’” Owen uses a broader term when asks who’ll be coming around for Christmas lunch. It applies to the volunteers, as well as those being served lunch. “We invite everyone to come and celebrate with us who has a hole in their heart,” he says. “I’ve got a whole bunch of volunteers who over the past few years have lost children, and they say, ‘I cannot bear the thought of sitting at home staring at an empty chair at our Christmas table, with a hole in my heart.’ “[They say,] ‘I’d rather take that love that’s been robbed from me and give it to people who desperately need it.’”",2021-12-24 19:00:32,137461
society/2021/jul/29/from-its-not-a-race-to-go-for-gold-how-scott-morrison-pivoted-on-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout,Australia news,From ‘it’s not a race’ to ‘go for gold’: how Scott Morrison pivoted on Australia’s Covid vaccine rollout,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/29/from-its-not-a-race-to-go-for-gold-how-scott-morrison-pivoted-on-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout,"It is the phrase the prime minister used repeatedly at the start of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout: “It’s not a race.” As Australia lags behind much of the world in getting jabs into arms, his choice of words has come back to haunt him. Scott Morrison’s critics accuse him of attempting to rewrite history by claiming he wasn’t talking about getting people vaccinated when he uttered the now infamous phrase, but the regulatory approval process that preceded it. “When we made those remarks, we were talking about the regulation of the vaccines. I’m not sure if people are aware of that,” Morris told Seven’s Sunrise program on Thursday. However, the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on 25 January and AstraZeneca on 16 February, but the first recorded mention of “not a race” wasn’t until March, when the vaccine rollout had already commenced.
10 March Morrison said it at a press conference on 10 March after more than 100,000 vaccine doses had already been administered. The prime minister was not the first person to say it, it was the secretary of the health department, Prof Brendan Murphy, who first uttered the line when asked about when Australia would get to 1m doses administered: This is not a race. We have no burning platform in Australia. We are taking it as quickly and carefully and safely as we can. We’re not like the US or the UK or most other countries in the world where they’ve got people in hospital dying. We can take our time, set up our systems, do it safely and carefully, we are expanding our rollout every day. 11 March Morrison ran with this line on Sunrise on 11 March when asked whether the vaccine rollout had been slow in some states. He initially credited Murphy: We will get this done by October as we said we would. But we have got to do it safely and as Brendan Murphy said yesterday, this is not a race, what is most important is the health and safety of Australians in the vaccination program and that is what we are principally focused on. And that rollout will gain speed towards the end of this month and we will see the Australian produce vaccines coming into the program and that means we will be able to be rolling them out in terms of supplies, around a million a week. When we get to that scale, I think we will see a real gear change. On the same day on Nine’s Today Show he repeated it when asked if Australia would meet its October deadline for the vaccine rollout: The key is, it’s not a race, right. It’s not a competition. You’ve got to do it safely, you’ve got to do it carefully and you’ve got to do it in partnership. And that’s what we are doing. We’re vaccinating Australia, that will open Australia again, and importantly, that will be great news for the tourism industry together with the packages we’ve announced today. And then at a doorstop when asked if Australia would still open international borders as planned by the end of October: The vaccination program done safely, done properly, which is what we’re doing here in Australia. It’s not a race. It’s not a competition for the sake of people’s health – you get it right. And that’s exactly what we’re doing and, where we are, our October deadline is the one we’re absolutely working to – there’s no change to that.
14 March Then Morrison was asked at a doorstop in Castle Hill in Sydney’s north-west about whether Australia was still on target to have everyone receive their second dose of vaccine by the end of October. He indicated GPs meeting targets could get more vaccine to meet demand: Now, those who are actually meeting the targets and ensuring the doses are administered. Now, where there’s spare capacity in state systems, well, we’ll send doses there too on a dynamic basis to ensure that we are keeping pace. But it’s not a race. It’s not a competition. It’s about the health and safety of Australians.
31 March In Adelaide he was again asked about the slow vaccine rollout, and repeated Australia was on track for its October deadline: It’s not a race, it’s not a competition, I am not interested in, you know, this state or that state. I’m interested in Australians being vaccinated safely, with appropriate care and support given to all of them. Australia has put itself into position to have a manufactured vaccine here in Australia. We’re not relying, like most of the countries in the world, for vaccines to be coming from somewhere else. Since then, the prime minister stopped using the phrase, and it only appears in press conferences or interview transcripts when the phrase is being repeated back to the prime minister. Now with the Olympics buoying the spirit of Australians stuck in lockdown, Morrison has had a change of heart on sporting analogies when it comes to the vaccine. “What we want to do is make sure we hit, hit these targets, set these targets right,” Morrison said of the vaccine rollout on Wednesday. “And, then all of Australia, like our Olympians, we go for gold on, on getting those vaccination rates where we need to go, because the supply’s there, the distribution’s there, the pharmacists, the GPs, the clinics, and we make a, we make a gold medal run all the way to the end of this year.”",2021-07-29 03:41:16,127456
world/2021/jul/30/music-fast-food-and-mud-at-londons-summer-vaccine-festival,World news,"Music, fast food and mud at London’s summer vaccine festival",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/30/music-fast-food-and-mud-at-londons-summer-vaccine-festival,"It certainly felt like a British music festival. A band was playing on the main stage, food vans dispensed trays and across the field people filed in and out of a big tent. There was even standard festival weather: bright sunshine with the threat of rain and, inevitably, mud. This was no Glasto, though. It was the summer vaccine festival in east London, where people were being encouraged to walk in, get a Covid jab and then enjoy free food and music. Several of those who went to get their doses on Friday said they had just happened upon the festival as they passed Langdon Park in Tower Hamlets. They heard the music, smelled the food and decided to head in and get vaccinated while they were there. “It’s lovely,” said Dhilshana Shiraj as she waited to receive her second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. “I could get the jab and bring the kids along as well, so they could enjoy themselves.”
Tower Hamlets council and Barts Health NHS Trust put on the outreach event, one of several they are running. “If the people won’t come to the vaccine, then take the vaccine to them,” said Tejal Patel, a senior pharmacist who was overseeing the operation. They are motivated, in part, by relatively low rates of vaccine uptake in the borough. Patel said there were particular concerns about uptake among people of some minority ethnic backgrounds and religions, as well as younger people more generally. Local health officials had found it useful to work with temples and mosques and to run events such as the festival in their efforts to tackle the problem, she said, and their initiatives had reached 15,000 people in the area since they started.
If the implicit threat of ongoing restrictions for those without a vaccine passport are a stick, then the summer vaccine festival is a carrot. Shiraj was enthusiastic about the idea, suggesting that the sound of the music would draw people in the surrounding area to the park. She said she had found getting her first dose a nerve-racking experience in what were more imposing and clinical surrounds. Having the second during a visit to a mini-festival near her home was a very different experience. “I feel more relaxed if I have something to distract me,” she said.
Some of those heading to the tent said they had an appointment for their jab, but were taking the opportunity to get it more quickly. Ian O’Shaughnessy was not one of them. He had held off for fear of being used as a guinea pig. But he saw the tent and heard the music as he was passing on his bike. “It encouraged me,” he said, adding that he may not have taken the step had he been required to book an appointment at a vaccination centre. Having had his first dose though, he said he would definitely return for his second in due course. One vaccinator who has worked on outreach programmes in the past explained that such events are acutely vulnerable to the weather turning. So it proved on Friday as spells of sunshine were interrupted by driving rain. Officials, however, said they would be running the festival all weekend. They hope that as words gets around, hundreds of people will have been vaccinated by the time they pack up.",2021-07-30 15:50:50,127098
society/2022/apr/26/murder-young-woman-mexico-femicide,Society,‘Femicide nation’: murder of young woman casts spotlight on Mexico’s gender violence crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/murder-young-woman-mexico-femicide,"“Don’t take risks – stay with us,” says one of the slogans at the Nueva Castilla motel, a $37.85 (£30) per night roadside inn in the Mexican city of Monterrey. But the horrifying discovery of a dead teenager in the lodge’s water tank has sparked a nationwide outcry and protests in a country facing a spiraling femicide crisis that saw 1,000 women murdered last year because of their gender.
Demonstrators gathered outside the motel on Monday night for the latest in a series of rallies demanding justice for Debanhi Susana Escobar Bazaldúa, whose disappearance and apparent murder have rekindled devastating memories of a wave of killings in the border city of Ciudad Juárez two decades ago. “Femicide nation,” read one of dozens of handmade placards left outside at a shrine remembering the 18-year-old law student. “We are destroyed inside,” the victim’s father, Mario Escobar, told journalists on Saturday as his daughter was laid to rest at a hilltop cemetery in northern Mexico.
Mystery still surrounds what happened to Escobar, a budding lawyer who vanished after leaving a party in the early hours of Saturday 9 April and whose corpse was only found last Thursday, 13 days later. But her case – the latest in a string of gender-related killings and disappearances of young women this year – has scandalized Mexico. At least 52 women have been reported missing in Nuevo León this year, the majority in or around the capital, Monterrey. After Escobar argued with friends, a taxi was reportedly called to take her back to her home in the industrial suburbs of Monterrey. Instead, for reasons unknown, the teenager was left on an empty motorway a few hundred metres from the motel. The driver, who has been accused of making unwanted advances on his passenger, took a haunting final photograph of the student standing alone on the roadside in a long brown skirt and high-top trainers. Video evidence reportedly shows that soon after being dropped off, at about 4.30am, Escobar entered the Nueva Castilla motel. “Debhani went into the building and they are trying to understand what happened … and why she ended up inside this cistern,” her father told reporters on Monday.
Investigators, who say Escobar died from blunt force trauma to the head, initially suggested the victim might have accidentally fallen to her death – a version her father has emphatically rejected, claiming she was beaten and strangled. “This was murder. They killed her … and I will not stop until this is cleared up,” Mario Escobar, who commissioned a second independent autopsy and vowed to seek a third if necessary, told reporters. Public anger has been compounded by the fact that it took nearly a fortnight for Escobar’s body to be found, despite police searching the motel on at least four occasions in an operation that included sniffer dogs and drones. Escobar’s death has exposed what activists call Mexico’s worsening gender violence crisis and the botched and apathetic response from authorities. Last year Mexico recorded 1,015 cases of femicide – when a woman is murdered specifically because of her gender – compared with 977 in 2020. Overall, about 3,500 women were killed. “What happened to Debhani happens in thousands of other cases across the country on a daily basis,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, the executive director of Amnesty International in Mexico. “Eleven women are killed in this country every day. We have at least 20,000 women who are missing in Mexico. And the state’s failures in searching for these women and investigating what has happened to them have remained unchanged for almost 30 years now,” she added.
Activist Frida Guerrera, who tries to track down the perpetrators of such crimes, denounced what she described as a never-ending nightmare: “It is every single day.” Guerrera blamed rampant impunity for the emergency in a country where more than 90% of all crimes go unsolved. “When a woman is killed and nothing happens, it kills her whole family, her whole society. Police will find the body sometimes, and then the investigation just stops, so the predators are never brought to justice, and by the next day, they’ve taken another girl. People don’t understand until it’s their own daughter,” she said, urging Mexicans to take the crisis more seriously. “Society will forget again like it has forgotten before. But society should in reality be very worried.”
Many women’s rights advocates hoped for progress after the supposedly progressive Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected president in 2018.
Yet López Obrador, a 68-year-old nationalist known as Amlo, has repeatedly clashed with the feminist movement, at times suggesting such campaigners were the tools of his conservative political rivals. In early 2020, after a series of murders provoked demonstrations that some called Mexico’s feminist spring, masked protesters surrounded the presidential palace in Mexico City and daubed its walls with the words: “Amlo is killing us”. Last week, after Escobar’s body was found, Amlo drew further criticism for claiming citizens had no reason to worry. “This happens everywhere,” he said. Olivares Ferreto voiced frustration at what she called Amlo’s repeated attempts to downplay the scale of the violence and government hostility towards “the legitimate struggle of Mexican women” to be safe. “This is one of the governments that has been most vocal about attacking the feminist movement in recent decades,” she said. “All we want is for the state to do its job. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel.” Olivares Ferreto remembered how nearly two decades ago her human rights group had released a report called Intolerable Killings about an internationally notorious wave of femicides in Ciudad Juárez – and the bungled official response. “Tragically, what was happening in Ciudad Juárez in the 1990s, is now happening across the entire country,” she said. “This country has become one big Ciudad Juárez.”",2022-04-26 16:00:36,144985
lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/a-letter-to-my-husband-who-had-an-affair-and-blamed-me,Life and style,"A letter to … My husband, who had an affair and blamed me",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/a-letter-to-my-husband-who-had-an-affair-and-blamed-me,"I have been married to you for 20 years. You are from a wealthy family, whereas I was proudly working class. I was determined not to be a dependent wife, but you insisted on keeping our finances separate from the outset. I paid some bills, you paid others. We had no joint account, not even for food. I happily left my job, home and friends to come and live with you in this beautiful country. We were so happy, with shared interests and a nice house. You had your own business and I started a new career. I know there must be something in you that met my needs, too. I think I found your supposed sensitivity attractive. Recently, I found a letter to myself written soon after moving in with you, telling myself to be more understanding, to respect your need for space, not to get angry with you if I felt you weren’t taking enough care of me. At times, your snappy demands for perfection left me reeling with self-doubt. In between, however, we had brilliant times. I learned how to please you. We lived simply and my occasional confused emotional upsets or your strange depressions didn’t overly disrupt our lifestyle. Didn’t all couples have their ups and downs? You were always so well-mannered and charismatic when we were out and I was proud to be your wife. Sometimes I felt upset by what I thought was your lack of understanding, but you were easily able to make me feel it was me who didn’t understand you. Then I felt terrible. Your disdain for other people saddened me and the way you timed to the minute how long workmen spent on a job embarrassed me. Life became gradually greyer. I became irritable with good friends and, frighteningly, occasionally took on the demanding personality traits I’d learned from you. In recent years, I felt my self-esteem rising when I was promoted. You felt I was working too hard and complained that my job was making me cold and unaffectionate. I lost interest in sex. You had long, enjoyable spells of not working. When I was envious, you suggested I take vicarious pleasure in you having such a good time. I berated myself for being uncharitable. At weekends, I was too tired to do what you wanted, so you went out without me. You grumbled about needing sex and how I had changed, how you couldn’t stand it any more. I thought maybe, when I retired, things would be easier. At other times, I felt that I couldn’t cope with your uncaring attitude. I threw myself into work but that simply made me more tired. And then I discovered you were having an affair. I was devastated and pleaded for us to try again. I would give up work, I wouldn’t be tired any more; we could use this as a stepping stone to a better marriage. You listened, but chose to move in with your lover shortly after I found out. What really hurt was your inability to take responsibility for your infidelity. I don’t know what I can wish for you, but I hope you find peace and compassion within you, without which life is empty. But I can’t help you now. Sincerely, your wife, set free This article was amended on 30 March 2017 to remove personal information.

global-development/2021/may/28/argentina-sends-dna-test-kits-embassies-find-juntas-disappeared-victims,Global development,Argentina sends out DNA kits in drive to identify thousands ‘disappeared’ under dictatorship,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/28/argentina-sends-dna-test-kits-embassies-find-juntas-disappeared-victims,"The Argentinian government has sent hundreds of DNA testing kits to its consulates around the world in a groundbreaking effort to put names to unidentified victims murdered in the “Dirty War” waged by the brutal military dictatorship four decades ago. Last month, the Argentinian authorities, in collaboration with the National Commission for the Right to Identity, the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo movement and investigators from the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), launched its international Right to Identity campaign, committed to putting a name to every woman, man and child killed by the military junta in Argentina in the 1970s and early 80s. After the 1976 coup, Argentina’s military set about systematically crushing any potential opposition, and eventually “disappeared” and murdered 30,000 people, almost all of them civilian, unarmed non-combatants.
The abuses meted out to “los desaparecidos” in Argentina’s Dirty War have inflicted a deep trauma on the Argentinian psyche. Pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth and were then murdered. At least 500 babies were taken from their parents while in captivity and given to childless military couples to raise as their own. The task of identifying victims of the dictatorship is a herculean one, starting with discovering where the military buried the bodies of their victims. After the return of democracy it was discovered that many victims were hidden in mass unmarked graves, some in municipal cemeteries. Others washed up on Argentina’s beaches after they were drugged and thrown into the Atlantic Ocean from aircraft in macabre “death flights” organised by the military. Last year, the EAAF, which was nominated for the Nobel peace prize in 2020, started a campaign to identify some 600 remains recovered in the years after the war and believed to be people “disappeared” by the junta. However, their efforts have been thwarted by missing genetic data.
Now the search for the missing families has been extended internationally with the government instructing Argentinian embassies and consulates around the world to help find missing relatives who could supply DNA to assist with the identification. The first DNA collection kits arrived two weeks ago at the Argentinian consulate general in Rome. It is hoped that testing in Italy will reveal many of the missing identities. Hundreds of thousands of Italians emigrated to Argentina in the late 19th century and early 20th century and almost 700,000 Argentinians hold dual citizenship. Many Italians also travelled to Argentina during the military dictatorship to join the resistance against the far-right regime. In October 1982, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published a list of 297 Italians aged 17 to 29 who disappeared while in Argentina. Maco Somigliana, who has been a member of the EAAF team since 1987, said: “We’ve been able to identify around 1,000 remains of victims of Argentina’s dictatorship. There are 75 Italians reported as kidnapped during the dictatorship and we’ve been able to positively identify five of them so far.” The Guardian has seen an official list of 45 desaparecidos of Italian origin, who have yet to be identified. The search for their families, which has already started, will be led by two Argentinian consulates in Italy, which will collect DNA in Italy, Albania, Malta and San Marino.
Those who believe they may be relatives of desaparecidos will have to give a blood sample so the mitochondrial DNA can be traced. The drop of blood, taken and collected in a special container, will then be sent on a diplomatic flight to Córdoba in Argentina, where the EAAF forensic laboratory is based. Ana de la Paz Tito, Argentina’s consul general in Rome, said: “With the help of science, Argentina has strengthened its path towards the search for truth. Bones can speak. Science can make bones talk. “The right to identify the bodies of the desaparecidos, their children, is a fundamental right, such as freedom, health, work and education. This right, in my country, had been violated by the state itself. And that tragedy pushes us Argentinians, today, to bring truth to those victims and their families. Because the truth helps us increase our collective memory and avoid the repetition of these tragedies.” Once the remains have been identified, they will be returned to their families. This procedure is free and confidential and there will be financial compensation for relatives of the victims.
Jorge Ithurburu, president of the Rome-based human rights organisation 24 Marzo, which takes its name from the date of the coup, said: “It is important to identify these people – burial is a right for all – but it is also a way to allow relatives, who have lived for decades in a sort of limbo, to mourn their loved one. “The idea is to ensure these people stop being desaparecidos and that we give them a name, give them justice and that finally we are able to find out the cause of their death,” he said. Finding and identifying the bodies is a task that requires patience. Azucena Villaflor, the founder of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, a group of mothers of the “disappeared” who confronted the military junta demanding to know the fate of their children, was herself kidnapped and then thrown into the Atlantic in December 1977. Villaflor’s body washed up on a faraway beach shortly afterwards and was hidden by local police in an unmarked grave. It was not until 2003 that Villaflor’s murder was certified after Somigliana’s team found where the police had secretly buried her. The EAAF have since applied the skills they acquired in Argentina elsewhere, identifying victims of summary executions and genocide around the world, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Africa, Mexico and Asia, including the identification of the body of Che Guevara, the Cuban-Argentinian revolutionary, in Bolivia. They also participated in the case of the 43 students massacred in 2014 in Mexico’s drug war at the request of the families of thevictims. • This article was amended on 28 May 2021.

australia-news/2021/sep/29/nsw-governments-assessment-of-raising-warragamba-dam-wall-totally-inadequate-critics-say,Australia news,"NSW government’s assessment of raising Warragamba dam wall ‘totally inadequate’, critics say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/29/nsw-governments-assessment-of-raising-warragamba-dam-wall-totally-inadequate-critics-say,"Environmental advocates have described the New South Wales government’s assessment of the proposed raising of the Warragamba dam wall as “totally inadequate” and called for alternatives, such as buying back houses in flood-prone areas, to be considered. The minister for western Sydney, Stuart Ayres, said the long-awaited environmental impact statement (EIS), published on Wednesday, would give the community “a full understanding of what is proposed” and the potential environmental impacts of raising the wall by up to 17 metres. The general public has been given 45 days to make submissions in response to the 4,000 pages of documents.
WaterNSW has proposed raising the dam wall to mitigate the risk to human life and to property in the flood plain of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment in the event of a major flood. But the plan, which would see flood waters temporarily held inside the Blue Mountains world heritage area and then released in a controlled way, has faced strong opposition because of the effects it would have on threatened species, cultural heritage sites and the outstanding values of the world heritage area. The EIS states the project would significantly reduce the risk of flood exposure to thousands of vulnerable people and their homes and that raising the wall would give emergency services more time to prepare and safely evacuate people. It estimates about 300 hectares (740 acres) of the world heritage area would be affected in a major flood event. “Importantly, the upstream impacts of the proposal must be carefully measured against the social, economic and environmental impacts flooding can have on downstream communities in western Sydney,” Ayres said on Wednesday. But environment groups, experts and an MP said the potential effects of the project had been understated at multiple stages in the 86 documents.

Jamie Pittock, a professor of environmental policy at the Australian National University, said the damage the project could cause for wildlife, including the critically endangered regent honeyeater, had only been assessed for a portion of the potential inundation zone. This was because WaterNSW had only examined the impacts of inundation for about 7.5 metres of the wall-raising project – instead of its full height – commencing at 2.78 metres above the full water level in the current dam. He said required offsets had also only been calculated for this portion of the project. “The government is trying to pretend that the area of the environmental impact is much less than it actually would be by carving out land at the bottom and the top of the inundation range,” Pittock said. “What they’re trying to do is reduce the offset costs, which are huge and potentially of a similar magnitude to the costs of building the dam.” Pittock has described the project as unjustified and called on the government to consider alternatives such as buying back houses on the lower flood plain.
Harry Burkitt, of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, said the EIS was “simply the latest act in ongoing political farce”. The foundation has campaigned against the project and on Wednesday pointed to the low survey effort undertaken for significant species including the koala and the platypus – issues the federal environment department also highlighted in earlier drafts of the assessment. “Last year the commonwealth environment department expressed the view that the dam project was likely to have ‘extensive and significant impacts’ on the national and world heritage values of the Blue Mountains,” Burkitt said. “Nothing has changed.” Chris Gambian, of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said: “The impacted areas have been massively underestimated, which is unsurprising considering the half-hearted way in which assessments were conducted.” Kazan Brown is a Gundungurra woman whose great-great-great-grandfather, John Joseph Riley, owned land at Burnt Flat, which is in the inundation zone. She said she would take some time to consider the report but expected the project, if it proceeded, would have a “huge impact” on the Warragamba community. Brown has previously raised concerns that surveys for culturally significant sites were only undertaken in 27% of the area that would be affected by the project. “We still have those concerns,” she said. “That’s nowhere near enough. If you’re going to flood something you need to be surveying a lot more than that.” The NSW Labor opposition said it would use an inquiry that has been established to examine the project to fully interrogate the EIS.
The independent MLC Justin Field called the EIS “totally inadequate”. “WaterNSW has clearly failed to address the myriad of concerns raised by NSW and commonwealth government agencies in leaked comments on earlier drafts of the report,” he said. “This is particularly the case regarding the assessment of biodiversity offsets and the impact of the 2019-20 fires, and the loss of world heritage and cultural heritage values in the area upstream that will be flooded by this project. Ayres said the EIS was “a thorough and robust assessment of the impacts and benefits of creating a flood mitigation capacity within Warragamba Dam”. “The Warragamba Offset Strategy considers all offset requirements for unavoidable upstream, downstream and construction area impacts,” he said. WaterNSW declined to respond to questions but said it encouraged members of the public to make a submission during the consultation process and read its information portal on the project. “The EIS public exhibition period runs until 12 November and offers the community and stakeholders full awareness of what is proposed and an opportunity to make submissions, as part of the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment EIS assessment process,” it said in a statement. Guardian Australia sought additional comment from Ayres.",2021-09-29 10:12:30,131044
culture/2016/apr/30/arts-institutions-ditch-tobacco-sponsors-health-experts-letter,Culture,"Ditch tobacco sponsors, health experts warn cultural institutions",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/30/arts-institutions-ditch-tobacco-sponsors-health-experts-letter,"More than 1,000 healthcare experts, including 57 professors, have signed an open letter calling on some of London’s most respected cultural institutions to abandon their financial links with big tobacco. The British Museum, the Royal Academy of Arts, the South Bank Centre and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, have long-standing lucrative corporate membership and sponsorship deals with two leading cigarette manufacturers, which are banned from advertising in the UK. The links have dismayed many in the medical community. “As a doctor specialising in the care of people with emphysema, I see the harm smoking causes every day,” said Dr Nick Hopkinson, reader in respiratory medicine and honorary consultant physician at the National Heart and Lung Institute, who is leading a campaign against the tie-ups. “Tobacco companies, which rely on getting people addicted to products, which maim and kill, must not be allowed to use arts sponsorship as a way to present [themselves] as respectable.” Tobacco giant JTI has corporate membership deals with the British Museum, the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Academy of Arts. JTI pays almost £40,000 a year to the Royal Academy for a premier membership package that sees the company listed in all exhibition catalogues. The company is also a corporate supporter of the Southbank Centre on whose website its logo appears. British American Tobacco is an associate member of the Royal Academy of Arts and a corporate sponsor of the London Symphony Orchestra. The Framework convention on tobacco control – to which the UK is a signatory – states that tobacco companies’ investment in corporate social responsibility initiatives should be treated as a form of advertising. In 2007, Philip Morris International Inc, manufacturer of Marlboro, stopped funding a number of New York art institutions. In their letter, published in Sunday’s Observer, health experts, including John Moxham, professor of respiratory medicine at King’s College London; Richard Ashcroft, professor of bioethics, Queen Mary University of London; and John Britton, director, UK centre for tobacco and alcohol studies, University of Nottingham; call on cultural organisations to rethink their relationship with big tobacco. They warn: “Tobacco advertising has now been banned along with sponsorship of sport. However, tobacco companies continue to use sponsorship of some high-profile arts organisations to promote the spurious idea that they are responsible corporate citizens.” Hopkinson added: “People can’t believe that the galleries, museums, orchestras they love could do this.”
Pressure on the likes of the Royal Academy to drop their links with big tobacco companies comes after BP ended its sponsorship of the Tate after 26 years following anger from environmental groups. The British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and other institutions have also been forced to defend themselves against claims that they accommodated the demands of the oil company, a major sponsor. In a statement to Hopkinson, Will Dallimore, director of public engagement at the Royal Academy of Arts, said that JTI’s support had “indisputably helped the academy fulfil its endeavours to contribute to the artistic life of the country”. A spokesman for the London Philharmonic said: “The LPO is grateful to JTI for its support and for providing our organisation with many platforms for us to make classical music more accessible and widen access to the arts.” A spokesman for the British Museum said: “JTI supports an acquisition fund at the British Museum, which allows us to acquire objects for the museum’s modern Japanese collection. JTI have supported the Museum since 2010. The British Museum is grateful to JTI for their long-term support.” A spokesman for JTI said: “It seems illogical that in a democratic society like the UK and at a time when funding for cultural and artistic institutions is under pressure, people would want to prevent a legitimate company like JTI from making a contribution to good causes.” A British American Tobacco spokesman: “Like many other businesses we support art and cultural institutions throughout the UK through corporate memberships. The small amount of corporate memberships we have do not result in our brands being featured anywhere but simply provide the opportunity for our staff, customers and business partners to attend events, concerts and exhibitions alongside other corporate members.” But Hopkinson suggested that the tobacco firms were using their support for the arts to retain key staff to give themselves a commercial advantage. “In its annual report, British American Tobacco identifies the difficulty recruiting people because of the industry’s poor reputation, as a risk to its future profits,” Hopkinson said. “Arts sponsorship is one way that the tobacco industry can enable its own employees to deceive themselves about the true nature of what they are doing.”",2016-04-30 19:34:13,5870

And this nightmare is happening in the 21st century. But I still do not give up and all of us believe in our victory, believe in the strength of our country!” In many ways the plight of Mariupol encapsulates the subconscious horror of Russia’s assault on Ukraine. With the besieged port city having long been deemed unsafe by news crews, few clear details now emanate – but what has done so hints at the nightmarish plight of many thousands of people trapped in a ruined city without food, clean water or power. Using diary material from residents, Daniel Boffey pieces together the story of how a city descended from normality to nightmare in a matter of days. The Weekly’s war coverage this week contains more strong reporting from correspondents Isobel Koshiw, Emma Graham-Harrison, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, plus expert analysis from Jack Watling and Patrick Wintour. The British royal family was in the news again after a tour of the Caribbean that seemed to cause discomfort on all sides.

society/2021/oct/30/record-number-of-domestic-abuse-victims-made-homeless,Society,Record number of domestic abuse victims made homeless,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/30/record-number-of-domestic-abuse-victims-made-homeless,"Domestic abuse caused nearly one in six new homelessness cases in England between April and June, with numbers rising even as the overall increase in homelessness slowed, according to government figures. Data out last week from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities shows that of 34,830 households newly assessed in early 2021 as homeless 5,590 were in that position because of domestic abuse. The number of cases attributable to domestic violence was the highest since records began in 2018 – and a third higher than in the same period in 2019. “It is completely unacceptable that women feel they must choose between staying with an abuser or facing homelessness or unsafe and unsuitable housing,” said Sarah Davidge of the charity Women’s Aid. “While the Covid-19 pandemic did not cause domestic abuse – only abusers are responsible for their actions – it has led to the escalation of existing abuse and closed down routes to safety for women to escape.” Research by Women’s Aid last year found that most women living with an abuser reported that the abuse had worsened during the pandemic, with a fifth prevented from leaving by a lack of housing or refuge space. “A sector facing a lack of sustainable funding, among other challenges, struggles to cope with the high numbers of women, and their children, who need to access their services,” said Davidge.
“Women’s Aid estimates that an annual investment of at least £409m is needed to run specialist domestic abuse services across England. The recent autumn budget missed an opportunity to direct much-needed financial support into services like this that would help more women to find safe accommodation and keep them off the streets.” She added: “The government must prioritise the safety and security of women, and their children, who are fleeing abusive households.” Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “It is heartbreaking and shameful to see the number of people made homeless as a result of domestic abuse at its highest level on record. Those fleeing abusive relationships need suitable, affordable and safe homes, but they are being woefully let down by the housing emergency. “Today’s mix of grossly expensive private rents, benefit cuts and a chronic lack of secure social homes can mean survivors are faced with the impossible choice of staying in a dangerous situation or becoming homeless if they leave. “If we had enough good-quality social housing, we could provide the sanctuary of a safe place to all those fleeing domestic abuse. To stop people becoming homeless, or putting their lives in danger to keep a roof over their head, the government must invest in building the new social homes this country desperately needs.”
A spokesperson for the Local Government Association also called for more funding for social housing, and added: “The recent domestic abuse bill focuses on accommodation-based support and has not taken into consideration any wider community-based support services. “We have outlined concerns that focusing effort and resources towards the crisis end of domestic abuse services will not prevent domestic abuse in the long term. Some consideration needs to be given to the wider support available to victims presenting as homeless, which is why we are calling for investment in community-based domestic abuse support services as well as accommodation.” A government spokesperson said: “We are investing millions into vital services to support domestic abuse victims, so those who leave their home have somewhere safe to go. This is alongside a pioneering £4.2m respite room pilot, providing safe housing and support for victims at risk of sleeping rough.”",2021-10-30 16:00:02,132841
australia-news/2021/nov/27/wedding-cakes-tweets-and-gay-teachers-how-will-the-religious-discrimination-bill-actually-work,Australia news,"Wedding cakes, tweets and gay teachers: how will the religious discrimination bill actually work?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/27/wedding-cakes-tweets-and-gay-teachers-how-will-the-religious-discrimination-bill-actually-work,"The Coalition’s religious discrimination bill was introduced on Thursday, almost three years after it was promised, and has implications for multiple areas of public life, from schools and workplaces to churches and hospitals. In the explanatory memorandum (EM) that accompanies the bill, the government sets out some examples of how it is designed to function. As some experts have pointed out, however, the bill is complex and may not overcome constitutional issues. This means that anyone attempting to argue a breach of the law – or defend being charged with one – may be able to make a case. Here is how the proposed law could apply to some scenarios: An employee tweets ‘gay people are going to hell’ It depends on the code of conduct set by the employer as it relates to statements of belief. The tweet could be grounds for the person to be fired, depending on the conduct permitted in their workplace. But if the person was a chartered accountant, for example, the person could not be disciplined by Certified Practising Accountants Australia. This is because employers can set codes of conduct regulating employees’ speech under the bill, but it prevents qualifying bodies, such as a professional association, from setting rules that would effectively restrict or prevent a “person from making a statement of belief”. A Christian baker who believes marriage should only be between a man and a woman refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding Does this one sound familiar? A similar example is also included in the EM. It says that unless the bakery is a registered charity – even if it was operated as a not-for-profit that invested its earnings in Christian social welfare activities – its owner would not be able to discriminate on the basis of religious belief or activity in relation to whom they sell cakes, or whom they employ, because it is a business. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
One of your colleagues tells you it’s ‘sinful’ for women to live with their partner unmarried As in the first scenario, if the workplace had a code of conduct that clearly defined acceptable behaviour, it is possible this would be grounds for disciplinary conduct. There are also state anti-discrimination laws, such as Tasmania’s, which bans speech that offends, insults or humiliates a person based on a protected characteristic such as sexuality or marital status. The proposed federal law, if passed, would override state laws to protect statements of belief, provided they are not malicious or if a reasonable person would consider they would threaten, intimidate, harass or vilify a person or group. If the colleague made multiple comments of this nature after being told they were unwanted, you may be able to argue that they were not made in good faith, and therefore not protected under the proposed law. A teacher is worried they could be fired for being gay at a religious school The federal sex discrimination act already contains an exemption for religious schools to discriminate against teachers based on gender and sexuality, provided it is in accordance with the beliefs of the school and done “in good faith”. The religious discrimination bill adds the power to only hire teachers who fit within the beliefs of the school’s religion, provided this restriction is made clear in a publicly available policy.
Despite the comments by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that he does not want to see teachers sacked for their sexuality, the assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, has said this could depend on whether the school is prepared to put that in its public policy. Equality advocates argue that a school could dismiss a teacher should their sexuality become known after their employment, if the school had made clear in their policy that being gay was not permitted before the person was employed. The EM cites the example of an Islamic school with a public policy that it only hired teachers of the same faith being permitted to sack a teacher who was hired as a Muslim but then converted to Buddhism. It says in this example the sacking “would not be unlawful if the actions conform to the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teaching of Islam, or was done to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of Muslim people”. A controversial religious leader who also runs a charity attempts to hire a function space for a fundraising event but is denied because of their beliefs A charity could make a complaint of direct discrimination in relation to goods and services due to its association with the religious beliefs and activities of its owner, the EM states. Similarly, if a person attempted to hire a function space for a religious gathering, but the owner said they did not permit this, that would be discrimination.",2021-11-26 19:00:38,135288
world/2022/feb/26/volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine-stands-defiant-in-face-of-russian-attack,World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy stands defiant in face of Russian attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine-stands-defiant-in-face-of-russian-attack,"He looked gaunt and unshaven after another sleepless night under Russian attack and bombardment. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a defiant tone in a video address on Saturday morning. “I’m here,” he said simply. And he was – in the centre of Kyiv, three days on from Vladimir Putin’s invasion, unbowed and going nowhere. “Good morning everybody! Ukrainians: there’s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s an evacuation,” he said. “I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state, our territory, our Ukraine, our children. That’s all I have to say. Glory to Ukraine!” Zelenskiy had chosen a backdrop for his Telegram channel video: the capital’s House of Chimeras. The art nouveau building designed by the Polish architect Władysław Horodecki is immediately identifiable. It boasts mythical figures and elephant-head gargoyles. The address – Bankova – is Ukraine’s equivalent of Downing Street. A hundred metres down the road is the presidential administration building. Zelenskiy had made another video address on Friday night, accompanied by his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, the country’s PM, Denys Shmyhal, and senior advisers. “I am staying in the government quarters together with others,” he said. He told his compatriots that it was likely to be another bruising night, as Russian forces tried to encircle and to seize Kyiv. “The enemy has designated me as target number one, and my family as target number two,” he said, urging citizens to resist with unity and strength. The longer Zelenskiy manages to hold out, the more heroic a figure he appears, at least in the eyes of a growing number of Ukrainians. “I didn’t like him before and didn’t vote for him. But I now see him with new respect,” Olga Bileychuk said, speaking from the western city of Lviv. “He’s doing a good job.” Kristina Berdynskykh, one of Ukraine’s top journalists, was also praising. “I have a lot of complaints against Zelenskiy over his domestic politics. But the way he behaves during the offensive of absolute evil against Ukraine is real political leadership and tremendous courage,” she tweeted late on Friday.
Zelenskiy, a former TV actor and comedian, won a landslide victory in the spring 2019 presidential election. He promised to bring peace to the east of the country and to negotiate with Putin. Three years later he finds himself at war with Russia and leading an against-the-odds struggle against Kremlin occupation and national extinction. In the run-up to this week’s invasion, Zelenskiy’s ratings had fallen. One critique was that he had lagged behind events – offering to declare Ukraine a neutral country, for example, once it was too late and Russian bombs were already falling. There were disagreements with the international community too over the threat from Moscow. For weeks, the Biden administration warned that Putin had assembled an invasion force on Ukraine’s borders and was preparing to go in. Zelenskiy demurred. He shrugged off predictions of doom and criticised London and Washington for removing their diplomats to Lviv. There was no reason to panic, he said. “He’s always two or three steps behind what is happening. He can’t get out of his square box,” one former senior government official said. “It’s like it’s theatre, not fact. The situation is life and death, a real tragedy for thousands of people.” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, advised him badly, the official added. And yet Zelenskiy has behaved with courage and extraordinary resilience in the dark hours since Russia’s military offensive began at 5am on Thursday. The US government and, according to sources, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have offered to get Zelenskiy out of Ukraine to prevent his capture by Russians. He has refused to go. “The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelenskiy said, according to US intelligence officials quoted in the Washington Post. The answer suggests the president has not lost his sense of humour, visible in his recent iPhone videos, delivered with a weary smile. His family has been taken to a place of safety, he said on Friday.
Zelenskiy’s fate over the coming days is grimly uncertain. There is no doubt that Putin is determined to capture Kyiv and to remove Zelenskiy’s pro-western and pro-Nato administration. Moscow’s apparent goal is to install a Russian puppet regime, as in separatist Donetsk, and to annex de facto a vast area that Putin considers to be “historical Russia”. When he sent in the tanks this week, Putin claimed he was undertaking a mission to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine. On Friday Putin called Ukraine’s leaders fascists and drug addicts. Ever since the Maidan uprising in 2014 against the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, Kremlin state channels have suggested the country is run by far-right extremists. The claim is ridiculous. Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker – something he showed off in his moving address to the Russian people on Wednesday evening, hours before the invasion began. He is also Jewish. He lost relatives in the Holocaust and his grandfather fought against Hitler. His friends and senior advisers come from TV show business. For now, at least, Zelenskiy appears buoyant. In his video address on Saturday he said Ukraine had successfully fought off “enemy attacks”. “We are defending our country, our land,” he said, pointing out that Kyiv remained under government control. “The occupiers wanted to capture our capital and install their puppets like Donetsk. We broke their idea.” He added: “I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.” Kremlin brute force and air power may yet prevail. But Zelenskiy has already earned his place in history, as the leader of nation under fire, fighting for its survival.",2022-02-26 13:52:35,140765
film/2021/sep/27/oscars-race-nominee-predictions-film-festivals,Film,Where does the Oscar race stand after this year’s big festivals?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/27/oscars-race-nominee-predictions-film-festivals,"As we all edge slowly closer to something vaguely sorta kinda resembling a loose idea of normality, so too does Hollywood, its relatively fixed annual schedule going from blurry to a bit less blurry. After an almost normal summer, the fall festivals followed and while they weren’t quite back up to snuff (some had a semi-virtual element, some big films were notably missing), there was a dramatic improvement from 2020 and, importantly, they were pulled off with very few infections.
But where do we stand after the major trifecta (Venice, Telluride and Toronto) has been and gone? It’s usually a time to sift through the good and bad reviews to see which Oscar contenders have and haven’t arrived and try to start smoothing out this year’s soon-to-be-overtold narratives. To start though, we go back to Sundance, a less awards-y festival but one that has still introduced early films and performances that have lingered throughout the year. In 2020, The Father, Minari and Promising Young Woman all premiered, an unusually bountiful edition for Oscar movies. This year’s was virtual, meaning that the bigger movies mostly decided to bow out, which allowed room for small films to either rightfully get some usually restricted air or get bullishly heralded as films that deserve more air than necessary. One of the latter examples was Coda, a sweet but pedestrian drama about a wannabe singer with a deaf family, that led to a record-breaking $25m sale to Apple. But it landed on the platform with very little fanfare this summer and is unlikely to resonate for long enough with voters. Rebecca Hall’s elegant directorial debut Passing might be a little too small for much love from the Academy but it features a dazzling turn from a never-better Ruth Negga, who could scoop up some best supporting actress buzz, especially with the film screening at the New York film festival this month. Ann Dowd could also see herself in that race for her performance in the devastating school shooting aftermath drama Mass but it could be too under-the-radar to make an impact, similar with the low-key Jockey, which Sony Pictures Classics will push for a best actor nod for Clifton Collins Jr. The only other real contender was Flee, a universally acclaimed animated documentary about an Afghan refugee which is set to be a strong player in three major races: animated, international and doc features.
Leaping forward to the summer and a back-to-normal Cannes, after a year off, and a bumper crop of delayed movies. But while Croisette faves, from Mia Hansen-Love to Arnaud Desplechin to Asghar Farhadi, were back, there was a lack of broader awards-buzzed titles. The delayed premiere of Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch was met with applause, bar a few fatigued detractors, and knowing the Academy’s love for his work, it could squeeze into a few categories if there’s room come December. British hope Mothering Sunday didn’t receive anything more than some polite nods of approval, despite Oscar winners Olivia Colman and Colin Firth starring, and while Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, his follow-up to The Florida Project, picked up raves for its star Simon Rex, it remains to be seen if he can graduate from critics circle wins to the Oscars. Then came Venice, the most reliable of all festivals for Oscar movies (previous years have seen best picture winners Birdman, Spotlight, The Shape of Water and Nomadland all premiere) and a starry, auteury lineup. It kicked off with Pedro Almodóvar’s warmly received melodrama Parallel Mothers which launched star Penélope Cruz into the best actress race and the film becoming a dead cert for a best international feature nom (his last, Pain & Glory, also received a nod in the latter category and for its lead). There was also a successful bow for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s directorial debut, an adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s psychodrama The Lost Daughter, which could edge star Olivia Colman to her third nomination and maybe even second win if buzz is to be believed. Jane Campion’s much-anticipated return to the screen was also met with cheers, her unusual wild west drama The Power of the Dog which could nab Benedict Cumberbatch his second best actor nomination and see supporting love for real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst. All eyes were on Kristen Stewart and her Princess Diana drama Spencer which, like director Pablo Larraín’s last female-fronted biopic, Jackie, enraptured as much as it enraged. Anyone hoping for a conventional biodrama had best stick to The Crown and his “fable from a true tragedy” might be a little too offbeat to score with many voters (the more straightforward Jackie couldn’t break into the best picture race). But most agree that Stewart has cemented her place as a best actress nominee, her first to date. Denis Villeneuve’s big-budget sci-fi epic Dune received strong reviews and given that the majority of praise was aimed at the visuals, the film-maker could see himself with a second best director nod even if the film will probably be too genre-focused to break out of tech categories. Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel (his first of two Oscar-aiming movies this year) was met with a mixed reception and outside of costumes, and probably won’t find itself in the awards conversation.
It was then time for Telluride, another festival that took a year off for Covid, and another all-guns-blazing return. One of the biggest surprise premieres was King Richard, a drama about Venus and Serena Williams and specifically their father, a plum role for an in-need-of-a-hit Will Smith and one that most are predicting will push him back into the race for the first time since The Pursuit of Happyness in 2007, even if the film itself might be too formulaic to stand out. (Aunjanue Ellis could also get a best supporting actress nod for playing their mother.) There was also acclaim for another potential best actor contender, 2020 winner Joaquin Phoenix in Mike Mills’s C’mon C’mon, a black-and-white drama about the relationship between a radio producer and his nephew. It’s been called the director’s best to date and the “not a dry eye in the house” vibe of reviews suggests it could tug at the heartstrings of voters. The long weekend also saw Kenneth Branagh reveal his Roma in the shape of Belfast, a semi-autobiographical black-and-white drama that garnered some of his finest reviews for years. The film, which could also bring nominations for stars Caitríona Balfe, Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench, was also the winner of Toronto film festival’s people choice award, a handy Oscar indicator (previous winners have included Green Book, Nomadland, Jojo Rabbit, La La Land and 12 Years a Slave). Toronto was cursed with a weaker lineup than usual, thanks in large part to it being semi-virtual, lumbered with Dear Evan Hansen as an opener, a one-time hope that swiftly turned into a laughing stock (if the Golden Globes were happening next year it might have scraped together some musical noms but alas). Things improved slightly with The Eyes of Tammy Faye, a by-the-numbers biopic but with a standout central performance from Jessica Chastain as the gaudy televangelist. It’s as Oscar-friendly as they come – physical transformation, real life subject – and could gain her a third nomination. The most acclaimed film of the festival was Stephen Karam’s adaptation of his Pulitzer-shortlisted family drama The Humans, but with A24 partnering with Showtime to release (read: dump) it at Thanksgiving, it will most likely not make an impression with voters. Last week saw the New York film festival kick off with its sole major world premiere: Joel Coen’s noirish The Tragedy of Macbeth. Reviews were solid, with love for leads Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, but not overwhelmingly so and, given the overheated nature of the material, it might struggle.
So what’s next? More than ever, it really does feel like there are more unknown quantities after the end of the major festivals. The AFI fest will feature the world premiere of Tick, Tick … Boom!, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Netflix musical starring Andrew Garfield which, together with Steven Spielberg’s Christmas-set remake of West Side Story, will try to bring Academy voters back to a historically adored genre that’s been shut out since La La Land in 2016 (the latter is the more likely chance but buzz is strong on the former). Netflix also has the star-studded comedy Don’t Look Up from Adam McKay, last in the race for Vice, but despite the big names attached (Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet), the trailer suggests it might be too frothy to count. Similarly, their western The Harder They Fall boasts a stellar cast (Idris Elba, Regina King, recent first-time nominee LaKeith Stanfield, Delroy Lindo) but could be too genre-y to make an impact. They could have more luck with The Unforgivable, a drama based on Sally Wainwright’s ITV series, about a woman rebuilding her life after prison, starring Oscar winners Sandra Bullock and Viola Davis. There are also two much-anticipated returns for Oscar-friendly auteurs that are likely to feature in the race. The first is from Paul Thomas Anderson and his unusually titled 70s-set drama Licorice Pizza about a child actor played by Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper Hoffman with smaller roles for Bradley Cooper, Tom Waits, Sean Penn and Maya Rudolph. The Academy loves films about Hollywood and the recently released trailer suggests it could make for a suitable companion piece to Boogie Nights (which nabbed Anderson his first Oscar nom). Before the end of the year we will also have the new film from Guillermo del Toro, whose last offering The Shape of Water won best picture in 2018. Nightmare Alley looks pulpier from the trailer but with a cast including Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette and Rooney Mara, it shouldn’t be counted out. Other potentials include the Denzel Washington-directed, Michael B Jordan-led drama A Journal for Jordan about a soldier writing to his son, Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem starring as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in Being the Ricardos with an Aaron Sorkin script and, of course, Ridley Scott’s second Oscar play of the year: House of Gucci. It’s a juicy story of murder, betrayal and fashion with Lady Gaga and Adam Driver starring, but does the much-giffed trailer suggest it’s going to be a little too lurid for the Oscars? Remaining outside chances include George Clooney’s Tender Bar starring Ben Affleck (but the actor-director hasn’t had a hit, commercially or critically, for a while) and Apple’s Swan Song with two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali reuniting with his Moonlight co-star Naomie Harris for a sci-fi drama also starring Glenn Close. Seven safe-ish nominee bets Will Smith – best actor, King Richard Penélope Cruz – best actress, Parallel Mothers Kenneth Branagh – best director, Belfast Joaquin Phoenix – best actor, C’mon C’mon Olivia Colman – best actress, The Lost Daughter Jane Campion – best director, Power of the Dog Jessica Chastain – best actress, The Eyes of Tammy Faye",2021-09-27 18:38:45,131363
football/2022/mar/27/switzerland-remind-southgate-that-international-football-is-about-control,Football,Victory over Swiss reminds Southgate that internationals are about control | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/switzerland-remind-southgate-that-international-football-is-about-control,"Imagine that was a league game. England found a path to victory. They were better after half-time. They had the strength of character to come from behind. It’s a sign of a title-winning team that they can still win when nowhere near their best. A lot of the squad players had a run-out. Saturday’s friendly win against Switzerland, in that sense, was a satisfactory evening for Gareth Southgate. But this was not a league game. It was international football, so everything is heightened, hysterical and overblown, albeit not perhaps as much as it would have been in the pre-Southgate days. There is so little evidence available that everything has to be over‑scrutinised – except, perhaps, the opposition.
This is a very good Switzerland side. They’ve just progressed unbeaten through qualifying, sending Italy towards their ill-fated attempt at progressing through the playoffs. That was Murat Yakin’s first defeat in eight games as coach. They are, for what it’s worth, ranked 14th in the world, just nine places below England. Nobody had scored twice against them since the world champions France in the Euros last summer – and Switzerland ended up winning that tie on penalties. Switzerland are, by pretty much any measure, the best side England have faced since the Euros. But the tendency seems to be to think that, because it’s 41 years since England lost to Switzerland, then of course we should be beating this lot. But a win against Switzerland, in the present context, is a decent result. Viewing this with an eye on the World Cup, Switzerland are likely to be the level of the next best team in the group. There must also be a sense of realism, if a friendly is to have any purpose. It was not a decent performance. The best that could be said of the defending in the first half was that at least Harry Maguire wasn’t there to take the blame. It was so shambolic that Jordan Pickford – usual demeanour: kid who’s had a fizzy 1980s orangeade before 6am on Christmas morning – was telling people to calm down. That perhaps is an indication of why Maguire is necessary and, even more so, why England will probably play with two holding midfielders in the games that matter.
In that sense Saturday’s game felt like yet another example of familiar Southgate issues. There is the demand to attack, not to squander this unprecedented generation of creative talent, to unleash Jack Grealish. On the other hand, there is the reality of international football in which, necessarily given time constraints on coaches, attacking patterns are less sophisticated than in the club game. Italy and Portugal won the previous two Euros through the strength of their defence. France won the 2018 World Cup playing cautiously, relying on their attacking power when things went wrong. Germany won the 2014 World Cup by counterattacking. Even Spain, when passing teams into oblivion, were accused of being boring in the way they stifled matches through possession.
In June 1963, England beat Switzerland 8-1 in Basel. Later that year, they beat Northern Ireland 8-3. Perhaps, people began to think, Alf Ramsey might deliver on his promise that England would win the World Cup. But the following year, at a mini-tournament in Brazil, England lost 1-0 to Argentina in a game in which they had dominated possession. For Ramsey, this was confirmation of what he had already suspected: the highest level of international football is about control. It doesn’t matter whether you beat a lesser team 8-0 or 1-0; what matters is not losing against the best. England, particularly before half-time, lacked control. The Southgate template at the Euros was clear: a back four in games in which he expects to dominate possession; a back three in games in which that is less certain. Saturday felt like a slight tweak on that: a back three protected by just one holder in Jordan Henderson, flanked by Conor Gallagher and Mason Mount – an attempt perhaps to retain control but with a little more flair.
But it didn’t work because Switzerland kept winning the ball back in the England half and were repeatedly able to get balls into the box. When the wing-backs pushed up, there was a clear vulnerability behind them; when they didn’t, England were overmanned in the middle. Fielding two of Henderson, Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips (or possibly Jude Bellingham, although that remains largely untested) would seem an obvious solution. Then there was the well-worn trope of Harry Kane dropping deep. He is very good at it and it should be a key part of England’s armoury, but it’s largely pointless unless somebody runs beyond him. That is Raheem Sterling’s game, but it is not Phil Foden’s. In Foden and Mount, England have two tactically intelligent advanced midfielder-forwards. The thought of them playing together, creating angles, generating space, is mouth-watering, but it didn’t work against Hungary last October and it didn’t work on Saturday. In this structure, perhaps it is simply one or the other, with Kane and a runner.
For all the talk of sophistication, the England goals came in the most traditional ways imaginable: squeezing up to regain possession after a high ball in behind the full-back, then a penalty following a corner. Jack Charlton could have scripted them. There is a lesson in that. If you have control, there are plenty of ways to score. But if you don’t have control there are plenty of ways to concede. And that’s why control, in international football, is paramount.",2022-03-27 11:00:24,143194
commentisfree/2021/sep/30/woke-enemies-englishness-right-english-liberal,Opinion,‘The woke’ are just the latest faux enemies of Englishness conjured up by the right | Patrick Wright,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/30/woke-enemies-englishness-right-english-liberal,"Like some of the emeritus professors who have recently steamed into the Conservative party’s “anti-woke” campaign under the name of History Reclaimed, I grew up in a less fractured country, in which, stately occasions apart, waving union jacks seemed largely left to the National Front. In English classrooms, we were encouraged to be more moved by the famous list of “characteristic fragments” that George Orwell pulled together in the first months of the second world war, as he searched for a unifying “pattern” in the diversity of English life. He wrote of old maids biking to communion through autumn mists and the clatter of clogs in a Lancashire mill town. Orwell admitted that a Scottish or Welsh reader might be irritated to find his list was made of entirely English materials. Yet it was urban as well as rural, northern as well as southern, and definitely not centred on the values of the social elite. His working class may have left “the flag-wagging, the Rule Britannia stuff” to small minorities, but its members also shared the “connecting thread” of patriotism on which the warring state must rely. They may have had the foulest language in the world, but they bore no resemblance to the image of “idlers” condemned as “among the worst in the world” by present cabinet ministers Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss in the 2012 tract Britannia Unchained. For a couple of decades after 1945, Orwell’s England Your England remained a defining text for a nation that had set out to turn the patriotism of the war effort into a driver of social democratic consensus. That world had been largely dismantled by the end of the 20th century, and politicians who continued to appeal to Orwell’s “connecting thread” for a transformed and hugely different present were often faced with guffaws of disbelief. There was, however, one aspect of Orwell’s vision that is by no means so exhausted. His “England” was given urgency and coherence by the threat of an apparently triumphant Nazi Germany. That habit of defining England against a sharpening sense of encroaching danger has proved dynamic as well as enduring. I had reason to notice how changeable the perceived enemy might be while researching my book The Village That Died for England in the early 90s. Situated in a little valley on the Dorset coast, Tyneham was evacuated shortly before Christmas in 1943, and turned into a training ground for American and British forces preparing for D-day. The local officials and volunteers engaged in the painful task of counselling the last residents out of the valley reassured them they would be able to return once the war was over, and this promise would not be forgotten. After the victory, the landowners wanted their property back, and many in the area rallied behind them. The campaign was joined by Arthur Bryant, a popular rightwing historian and columnist whose reputation was still overshadowed by his prewar enthusiasm for Hitler’s Germany. It was Bryant, more than anyone else, who launched Tyneham into its postwar career as a radiant embodiment of all that had been best about England. In his version, the promise of return became Churchill’s personal pledge. The subsequent “betrayal” became the responsibility not of the Nazis but of the postwar Labour ministers who decided, in 1948, that, with the cold war under way, the War Office must keep its requisitioned land. Conservationists would rally to the defence of the flora and fauna, but it was not really on their account that Tyneham’s story would be rehearsed in countless articles and broadcasts over the postwar decades. It endured because it served as an allegory for those who believed that England had won a vast and costly war only to face destruction from within. In the early postwar years, this polarised way of telling the story of England had entered the political mainstream and was being put to work alongside “monetarist” reform by Tory revivalists. It was used to pitch the memory of the war at various embodiments of Thatcher’s “enemy within”, a term that she at first directed against the striking miners. Repeatedly, this was an England that blamed many of its woes on immigration but its memory was also rallied against the reforming agencies of the postwar state – centralised planning, comprehensive education, tower blocks, the anti-racist bureaucracy in local government, the arts establishment with its preference for arcane music and poetry that didn’t even rhyme. And when the domestic state was “rolled back”, the narrative of England betrayed came to be concentrated more fully on the European Union, understood through “Euromyths” of the sort peddled by freeloading English MEPs and an overpaid young bullshitter named Boris Johnson. As I suggested in this paper back in 2005, it is not Orwell who should be counted the enduring prophet of this resurgence, but the writer GK Chesterton, who portrayed the English as a “secret people” in the opening years of the 20th century. His blameless English aborigines had silently endured the yoke of baronial power and were then suffering under the Fabian state, with its metallic expertise. Chesterton initiated a vision of the English as a virtuous but silenced majority, largely innocent of their own imperial history, but surely capable of one day breaking out into a revolution that would make the Russian and French versions seem tame. Consider Nigel Farage on the morning after the 2016 referendum, hailing a victory for “real people”, distancing himself from the £350m-a-week-for-the-NHS-pledge, before settling down to a victory breakfast of kippers and champagne. In the Sunday Telegraph, meanwhile, Andrew Roberts (who is among the brave-hearted historians of History Reclaimed) hailed the Brexit-voters as “bloody-minded insurgents” who had risen up in the tradition of the peasants’ revolt. It was left to the former editor of that paper, Charles Moore, who has never borne much resemblance to a revolting peasant, to confirm the link: “I can testify how hard it is to assert our right against those in power.” No thought there for the looming difficulty of reconciling this abrasive English uprising with the view from Northern Ireland or Scotland. Whether its leaders knew it or not, Brexit was a performance mounted by politicians who used Chestertonian fables to take down a country that their policies had already turned into a land of seething resentments. Detailed plans for the separation were always in short supply, but the message was there in the insouciance of David Davis turning up to negotiate in Brussels with no papers, or Jacob Rees-Mogg sprawled like an etiolated dandy over several seats in the House of Commons. You could see it in Johnson’s unkempt mop of boyish hair as well as in Lord Frost’s union jack socks and Farage’s proudly brandished fag and pint. It is still there in the casual preference for plausibility rather than truth, the careless shrugs, the blending of dog whistle racism with the cod-heroism of no longer submitting to codes of conduct dismissed as elitist or “politically correct”. It is surely this proudly “unwoke” outlook, which happily appeals to the worst in people, that has proved the prevailing Englishness of recent years. And the future consequences? You can take your pick. “Global Britain”, if you can believe it, and if Johnson is able to manage the unruly English mount he has created for himself. For myself, I keep remembering the degraded Dorset valley Bryant described in 1954: “a desolate, uncared-for, rabbit-haunted wilderness of deserted, weed-ridden pastures, ruined houses and shell-swept, barbed wire entanglements.” History Reclaimed, indeed.

Doireann Ní Ghríofa first encountered it as a schoolgirl with a gift for daydreaming. By the time she found her way back to it, she was married and midway through a decade during which she was either pregnant, breastfeeding or both, her days filled with the “drudge work” of raising four small children. In snatched moments of solitude – invariably accompanied by a whirring breast pump – she would study her tatty photocopy of the poem, “inviting the voice of another woman to haunt my throat a while”. This incandescent, uncategorisable prose debut is the result of her invocation. It’s a book that is many things – a reimagining of an 18th-century life that combines scholarship with imaginative verve; an account of obsession and a meditation on the limits of biography; a memoir of post-feminist motherhood. It also features Ní Ghríofa’s own stirring translation of Eibhlín Dubh’s lament. What A Ghost in the Throat is not, however, is straightforward. It may have been written in borrowed pockets of time between supper and bed – indeed, it may only exist because Ní Ghríofa’s husband insisted on getting a vasectomy – but she is unabashed about the satisfaction she finds in homemaking and housework. “In such erasure, for me, lies joy,” she confides about ticking items off a diurnal list comprised of words such as “mop” and “laundry”.
She’s less confident when it comes to delving into archives. “I am merely a woman who loves this poem,” she says. But she also happens to be a published poet, and when it comes to prose, is incapable of delivering a dud sentence. This is a text that glints with treasures, from ruminations on the connections between “stanza” and the Italian word for room, to descriptions of “a shiver-bright day” and the “buttery hellos” of nodding daffodils. The book begins with words that will become its refrain: “This is a female text.” In entwining her own existence with the story of a lauded poem and its overlooked author, she busts open the idea of the female text to encompass not merely self-sacrifice and scars, but also merriment, desire, and fierce, sustaining curiosity. • A Ghost in the Throat by Doireann Ní Ghríofa is published by Tramp Press (£8.99).

Eliza Manners was caught doing 47mph in a 40mph zone on the M4 in an Audi in Brentford, west London, in March. When faced with prosecution, the 24-year-old, who runs her own interior design business, Eliza Manners London, wrote to Lavender Hill magistrates to attempt to avoid a heavy penalty, according to the Evening Standard. In a question about financial hardship, she responded “yes”, and, asked if paying a fine would pose financial difficulties, reportedly wrote: “It would cause me cashflow issues.” She was ordered to pay a £50 fine and £84 in court costs and fees, as well as being given three penalty points. The contact centre for London magistrates courts confirmed the fine to the Guardian and said there was a matter in the court records on or around 4 October for speeding. The youngest daughter of David Manners, the 11th Duke of Rutland, Lady Manners reportedly lives in a £700,000 apartment in Notting Hill. Manners and her siblings, Violet and Alice, have been compared to Downton Abbey’s Crawley sisters and were nicknamed the “bad Manners girls” when they were regulars on London’s social scene. Her family home is Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, which has featured in The Crown and The Da Vinci Code. The family spent the first Covid lockdown there together. Her company website cites her upbringing, describing the castle as “one of the UK’s most famous and unspoilt Regency buildings”. It says: “They say that children absorb their surroundings, and for Eliza, that is exactly the case.” Her circus-themed 18th birthday party featured live camels and was covered by Tatler magazine, which described it as “a night of surprises”. On Wednesday night she was pictured wearing a £1,600 Balmain dress at Harry’s Bar in Mayfair and last week she posted pictures on Instagram from Annabel’s, another Mayfair luxury establishment. Her Instagram account also features pictures from a recent holiday to Italy. She entered her guilty plea for the offence online in April through the single justice procedure and was sentenced on 4 October without an open court hearing. She reportedly did not declare any living expenses. Government guidelines say that the “minimum penalty for speeding is a £100 fine” but magistrates are able to lower penalties in exceptional cases. Manners did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.",2021-10-29 11:40:57,133085
world/2021/may/30/phone-intercepts-jordanian-prince-alleged-coup-attempt,World news,Phone intercepts shine more light on Jordanian prince’s alleged coup attempt ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/30/phone-intercepts-jordanian-prince-alleged-coup-attempt,"Aides to the former Jordanian heir Prince Hamzah sought pledges of allegiance on his behalf from tribal leaders and former military officers in the weeks before he was detained, conversations caught on phone intercepts and listening devices suggest. The recordings are key pieces of evidence in the Jordanian government’s case against two men accused of acting as proxies for Hamzah in a failed attempt to oust his half-brother, King Abdullah, as monarch. Both men – Bassem Awadallah, a former envoy to Saudi Arabia, and Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a cousin of the king – are expected to stand trial in Amman starting on Monday. The calls and intercepts, which have been heard by the Guardian, took place over three weeks in March, a period in which officials say Hamzah tried to rally support from figures who could elevate what officials describe as a seditious plot into a serious challenge to Abdullah’s reign. The recordings include the Arabic term mubayaa, which implies swearing an oath to a caliph or monarch. The use of such a phrase alarmed intelligence officials who had begun surveilling Hamzah and his aides, setting in motion a real-life Game of Thrones, which placed two of Jordan’s most senior royals at odds and implicated its two closest allies.
The Guardian on Wednesday revealed the US had warned of the alleged plot in a call to Jordan’s spy agency in March. At the same time, a report was handed to Abdullah, who had been frozen out of plans by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner to reshape the Middle East during the former US president’s tumultuous four years. The American warning came after Bin Zaid allegedly approached a US diplomat soliciting support for the former crown prince’s ascent to the throne. By then, intelligence officials had intercepted several calls that appeared to seek loyalty. One of the calls to a tribal official heard a voice saying: “Our guy has made a decision to move, do you pledge allegiance?” A bug placed in a meeting of tribal figures in northern Jordan recorded the men present discussing how to organise support for Hamzah. Meetings of civilians were to be kept to 15 people, while meetings of retired military leaders were limited to seven. The Jordanian case against Hamzah, who remains under house arrest, is that he sought to move against Abdullah, who removed him from the line of succession in 2004 and installed his son, around the time of a tragedy blamed on negligence at a hospital that killed seven patients in the city of Salt. “He arrived wearing his father [King Hussein’s] tie,” a senior official said. “There were messages between him and his friends saying ‘you should not take a photo with His Majesty’.” By mid-March, after the warnings had been delivered to the royal court and Jordan’s general intelligence directorate, officials believe Hamzah saw a confluence of circumstances – commemorations of a 50-year-old battle with Israel and of a decade-old youth movement, as well as Mother’s Day – as a chance to build momentum. “At that point Hamzah was asking for advice on how to proceed,” the official said. “He was told: ‘These decisions need well thought-out responses. When it’s time for the full knockout, you will know. “His people told those they had recruited: ‘When he acts, it is to be for the jugular.’” Regional sources said the alleged plot may have been an epilogue to a wider drama in the region over the past four years: Kushner’s attempt to launch his so-called “deal of the century” plan, which ripped up the rulebook on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was integral to Kushner’s ambitions. Awadallah had remained on close terms with Riyadh, and the Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, is understood to have flown to Amman the day after he was arrested to seek his release. Abdullah rigidly opposed the Kushner deal, as a direct threat to the kingdom’s custodianship of holy sites in Jerusalem – a key facet of Hashemite legitimacy – and a blow to hopes that Jordan’s significant population of Palestinian refugees may one day be able to return to their own state. Hamzah is understood to be confined to his home, and was last heard from in leaked videos in April claiming his innocence. • The photograph accompanying this article was replaced on 30 May 2021 because a previous image misidentified Prince Hamzah.",2021-05-30 04:00:43,123405
tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/moon-knight-review-oscar-isaac-is-a-crime-fighting-frank-spencer,Television & radio,Moon Knight review – Oscar Isaac is a crime-fighting Frank Spencer,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/moon-knight-review-oscar-isaac-is-a-crime-fighting-frank-spencer,"When Edwin Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding, he couldn’t have known that a century later the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be expanding even faster. But it is: there are a dozen planned MCU movies, including Spider-Man 4, Deadpool 3, Captain America 4 and Guardians of the Leatherette Spacesuits 5, only one of which I made up. Prof Brian Cox tells me that, at the current rate of expansion, if there aren’t already more Guardians of the Galaxy than there are galaxies, there will be before you have finished reading this article. In fact, the situation is even more worrying than his calculations suggest: the next Benedict Cumberbatch vehicle, which will be released this spring, is called Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It posits not one but many universes, all growing faster than the retail prices index. Into this inflationary gallimaufry of intergalactic flapdoodle comes Moon Knight (Disney+), a TV spin-off developed by the Marvel boss, Kevin Feige. Since 2018, Feige has been astutely plundering the Marvel database for obscure characters whose backstories can be fluffed for TV series. The results, such as WandaVision and What If …?, have been more rewarding than anyone who sat through Avengers: Age of Ultron might have imagined possible. Moon Knight is as witty and philosophically interesting as the first two. We may not need another hero, but, if we did, better Moon Knight than Dark Knight. Moon Knight made his first appearance in the comic Werewolf by Night in 1975. His backstory is uncannily similar to mine. The son of a rabbi, Marc Spector was a CIA-agent-cum-mercenary who was mortally wounded, then brought back to life by Khonshu to battle the bird-skulled Egyptian moon god’s no less freaky nemesis, Ammit. She, as you may recall from your primary school ancient Egypt project, has a hippo’s hindquarters, a lion’s forequarters and the head of a crocodile, making her, if not a looker in the conventional sense, quite the formidable foe. So that is Moon Knight, a nocturnal warrior battling evil for us schmoes, while sporting impressive abs and a cape so voluminous he would get it caught in his bicycle spokes if he didn’t tuck it into his posing pouch. (Just one of the reasons why he doesn’t cycle to work.) In Jeremy Slater’s TV retool, though, there is a twist. Every morning, Moon Knight wakes up in the body of a mild-mannered museum gift shop assistant called Steven Grant. Each night, before retiring, Grant chains one ankle to his bedframe and puts tape across his front door so he can check later if he managed to slip his restraints during the night. Why such precautions? He doesn’t know, because he has dissociative identity disorder. He has no memory of being a mercenary, nor of his role in the historic struggle between ancient Egyptian deities. Each day, before his first coffee, he wakes up to an existential crisis akin to those of The Metamorphosis’s Gregor Samsa, Phil Connors in Groundhog Day and Leonard Shelby in Memento. Oscar Isaac has great fun with the role, playing Grant as if Indiana Jones were tragicomically trapped in the body of Some Mothers do ’Ave ’Em’s Frank Spencer. His accent and bodily tics were reportedly inspired by Karl Pilkington of An Idiot Abroad. He ends phone calls to his mum with “Laters, gators” and so is temperamentally unsuited to the demands of the first episode, namely holding on to a mechanical flying scarab beetle that Ammit’s lickspittles covet, not to mention eluding parkouring CGI dogs in the museum and gun-toting men in black bent on shoving him and his cupcake van over the precipice of a corniche. That said, Grant’s veganism, presented here as typifying his wimpishness, is a misstep: every vegan I know would go fist of Khonshu on the ass of any barista who put cow milk in their cortado. One night, during a museum inventory check, Ethan Hawke appears to Grant, sucking in his cheeks and doing that thing where he stares implacably. Hawke has even more fun with role – Arthur Harrow, Moon Knight’s leading foe and the top Ammit lickspittle – than Isaac does with his. “Consider this,” says Harrow, staring through every-day-is-a-bad-hair-day locks. “If Ammit had been freed, she would have prevented Hitler, the destruction of Europe, the Armenian genocide, Pol Pot.” Whatevs, say the eyes of Grant. But the very suggestion that the liberation of Ammit would bring justice to a world overrun by little men overcompensating for big problems seems, as Guardian leader writers tell us, far-fetched. While it remains to be seen whether Konshu’s righteous warriors will defeat Ammit’s and whether Grant will realise his supposed destiny by the finale, one thing seems certain. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue to expand. Only She-Hulk, coming later this year on Disney+, may be able to halt it – and I bet even she won’t have the upper-body strength.",2022-03-30 16:30:26,142473
australia-news/2020/jul/27/down-here-things-look-ugly-remote-communities-feel-familiar-frustration-ahead-of-nt-election,Australia news,'Down here things look ugly': remote communities feel familiar frustration ahead of NT election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/27/down-here-things-look-ugly-remote-communities-feel-familiar-frustration-ahead-of-nt-election,"“Some people don’t like repeating themselves,” says Naomi Wilfred, an Alawa elder from Minyerri in the Northern Territory. She explains why people in the community – and in many other remote parts of the Northern Territory – feel a familiar sense of frustration come election time. “We’re repeating ourselves doing the same thing over and over and it just doesn’t work. “We give them what they need [by voting] but at the other end, what we need, we don’t get that.
“We have concerns around housing, fencing, everything. Some of [the homes] have rain problems. The renovations are not getting done properly. But whatever government policies, it’s not working. We vote for them and make them look good upstairs, but down here things look ugly.” In the Territory, the vast remote electorates known as “the bush” have historically been Labor heartland; often ignored as irrelevant to a political contest that plays out back above the Berrimah Line, in Darwin and its suburbs. In 2012, these remote communities unexpectedly put the Country Liberal party into power. Four years later they shifted back to Labor again – frustrated at the unfulfilled promises made by the CLP, whose term in power was overshadowed by incurable infighting and repeated scandal. In 2020, that sense that nothing ever changes is as strong as ever in the remote parts of the Territory. This year, the NT auditor general found that one of the Gunner government’s signature policies – the “room to breathe” Indigenous housing program – had been mismanaged so badly she could not tell “whether its objectives are being achieved economically, efficiently and effectively”.
In Minyerri and countless other communities, people still live too-many to a single home. Their properties still leak. Like they did in 2016 and 2012 and long before that. But that doesn’t necessarily mean votes in the bush cannot be valuable. In the 25-member NT Legislative Assembly, most seats attract fewer than 5,000 total votes, and even fewer in the bush. A few hundred votes can shift an entire Territory election. Larissa Baldwin, the First Nations justice campaign director for GetUp, has been traversing the Territory, working with community leaders and assisting people to enrol to vote. “When we talk to people specifically about the election, they feel very disillusioned with the process of voting,” Baldwin says. “It doesn’t matter which government it is, they feel their vote doesn’t matter.” The previous week, the chief minister, Michael Gunner, was in nearby Ngukurr announcing a Treaty process.
“We were talking to people about that and they said ‘is Treaty going to change housing, is Treaty going to give us access to dialysis?’,” Baldwin says. “For us it’s an issues-driven campaign and that’s what we’re talking to people about. It’s about the democratic participation of Indigenous communities and we really want to make sure people make informed votes. “I feel like people are a bit disillusioned at Labor, the promise of having so many Aboriginal members of parliament in there and the thought that this time could be different. It’s a little bit disheartening. “But there’s a lot of ways to influence political parties, and one of those is by raising community voices. People talking about food security, about social services, about a fair go for everyone. When those issues have more weight behind them, they come to the attention of people who may be ignoring them.”
GetUp is canvassing candidates and will prepare scorecards for how they stack up on issues – allowing people to vote based on which candidate best represents their views. After running a similar enrolment and engagement effort in remote communities during the federal election, feedback from the group’s supporters suggested it was one of the most valued campaigns. Voter enrolment among Indigenous people (68.2%) and all Territorians (85%) are well below the national average, and the Australian Electoral Commission has raised concerns that a cultural barrier exists in communities where people are disengaged. The NT electoral commissioner has said about 25,000 people are believed to be missing from the electoral roll. The AEC has suggested up to 42% of First Nations people are not enrolled. “Democratic participation in the NT matters, it matters to our members,” Baldwin says. “There’s nothing flash about getting people to enrol, but it’s important work.” Voters in remote communities have told campaigners their biggest concerns relate to over-policing, housing, health services and fracking.
The onshore gas industry, and the potential unconventional gas resource of the Beetaloo Basin, has long been posited as an economic and jobs panacea for the Territory – ironically to counter the economic bust cycle that arrived during the wind-down of the last big gas project, the Inpex plant in Darwin. The gas industry figure Andrew Liveris is heading the Territory’s Economic Reconstruction Commission, and has said in a series of recent interviews that onshore gas is critical to its future. Labor won the last election by promising a moratorium on fracking; but it has since held a scientific inquiry, allowed the industry to proceed with new regulations, and pinned some economic capital on its success. The issue, above all others, risks voter backlash in particular bush communities and seats. Minyerri has declared itself a fracking-free zone. Nick Milyari Fitzpatrick, a Yanyuwa man from Borroloola and community organiser for Seed Mob, a branch of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, says a survey in his home community found 96.8% of people did not want fracking to occur. “So much of the Territory is against fracking. The water table is sacred. We can’t be mucking around with the water table,” he says. “The fracking industry doesn’t have a social licence. At the election we can make that clear.”",2020-07-26 17:30:31,105106
sport/2022/may/29/nadal-overcomes-felix-auger-aliassime-to-set-up-novak-djokovic-quarter-final,Sport,Nadal overcomes Félix Auger-Aliassime to set up Novak Djokovic quarter-final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/29/nadal-overcomes-felix-auger-aliassime-to-set-up-novak-djokovic-quarter-final,"Rafael Nadal has played 112 tennis matches at Roland Garros over the course of his career and he has somehow lost just three times on these courts. But an even more absurd measure of his total dominance lies in how few players have even managed to push him close to the edge; to have made him truly doubt. Before Sunday afternoon, only twice over his 17 years had any opponent extended him to five sets at the French Open. Along came Félix Auger-Aliassime, who stepped on to Court Philippe Chatrier with quality, courage and belief in his capabilities, and he took advantage of a sub-par Nadal to force a fifth set and push him all the way. But even as Nadal struggled with his game, when he desperately needed to step up, he soared. Still in the fight for his 14th French Open title, Nadal edged out Auger-Aliassime 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals. As a consequence of Nadal’s victory, he and Novak Djokovic will resume their historic rivalry on the biggest stages when they face each other in the quarter-final for their 59th meeting on Tuesday. “In the end, the sport is normally very simple, no?” said Nadal afterwards. “When you play better you have better chances; if you play worse, then you have of course less chances, no? In that case, when I played well, I won the match. When I played not that well, I had a lot of troubles.”
For the match-up between his two employers, his nephew and his charge, Toni Nadal chose the most conspicuous seat in the house – front row of the presidential box. He watched on as, after the elation of Real Madrid’s Champions League win that Nadal attended, on an extremely cold afternoon Nadal started the match out of sorts. While Nadal sprayed errors and missed numerous break points, Auger-Aliassime served well enough and played solidly off the ground to lead 5-1. Nadal retrieved one break at the end of the set, and he began a seemingly inevitable recovery that culminated with a break at 4-3 in the second set. Nadal then rode all of his momentum to a two sets to one lead. Just as it seemed that Nadal was in control, however, he inexplicably started the fourth set with a flurry of unforced errors. Nadal lost his serve in his opening game, then after immediately retrieving the break he gave it up again with more poor forehand errors.
While Nadal struggled, Auger-Aliassime remained focused on himself. He peppered Nadal with well-timed drop shots, he continued to look for forehands to dominate with and he was supreme at the net. For his resilience and composure, he was rewarded with a fifth set. Throughout the final set, Auger-Aliassime continued to push himself to the limit, serving well and making difficult volleys. But Nadal made his move at 4-3, completely elevating his level by attacking returns and closing down the net himself. After pushing hard to create a break-point opportunity, Nadal chased down a drop volley and slipped a slice backhand into the open court to take the decisive break. As he served out the match with ease, after alternating between chants for the two players all match, the crowd finished cheering for one man only. “Being honest, every match that I play here, I don’t know if gonna be my last match here in Roland Garros in my tennis career, no?” said Nadal afterwards, referring to his chronic foot injury. “That’s my situation now. Of course I went through a tough process again with my foot, so I don’t know what can happen in the near future with my career. But that’s why I am just trying to enjoy it as much as possible.”
Auger-Aliassime has already lost a heartbreaking five-setter to Daniil Medvedev at the Australian Open this year, but despite more frustration he leaves Paris having further shown his progression. The 21-year-old’s attempts, along with coaches Fred Fontang and Toni Nadal, to turn him into a well-rounded player are bearing fruit. From the player who would run out of ideas in his early exchanges against the big names, here he continually searched for solutions and often found them. For Nadal, the next obstacle is clear. Earlier in the day, Djokovic moved past 15th seed Diego Schwartzman without incident, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3. “Playing him [Nadal] in Roland Garros is always a physical battle, along with everything else,” said Djokovic. “It happens. It’s a huge challenge and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros. I’m ready for it.” Later, Carlos Alcaraz moved into his first French Open quarter-final after defeating Karen Khachanov 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. He will face Alexander Zverev, the third seed, next.",2022-05-29 19:59:52,146417

We would all sit down and watch Dennis Potter and Twin Peaks together and my mum really encouraged me and my sister to see Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit – perhaps trying to give us an opportunity to tell her something. Then we both disappointed her by being straight. She had this romantic fantasy of herself as a mother who would be completely the opposite to the one in the show. I hate the word “quirky” but you just didn’t see that many female characters who were allowed to have a personality back then. I had loved Charlotte Coleman’s punk aesthetic in Marmalade Atkins and later in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Many years later I did a read-through with her and said, “My mum is a massive fan of yours.” And, because I had just been in Garth Marenghi, which had won the Perrier, she said, “Your mum must be so proud of you.” She was so sweet. She died about two weeks later and it was a real, real shock. She was lovely. Beards
I really had a thing about Jesus. I built a shrine to him in a medicine cabinet in my bedroom, not because I was religious but because I fancied him. I thought you could be into him in the way that you could be into A-ha. I just thought he was gorgeous. I’ve always liked bearded men. My friend and I would watch a VHS of John Boorman’s Excalibur over and over. It wasn’t fashionable to be bearded until The Lord of the Rings – and then onwards, thank God. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have a partner now. But back then very few people had beards except Merlin and Jesus. The gothic I loved The X-Files and Quantum Leap. Shows that were kind of supernatural felt huge to my teenage self, as if something was coming – actually it was just probably my future. Portishead felt connected to that, too: spooky and unknown. You don’t tend to connect gothic with the 90s, but there was plenty of that stuff to be found and believe me, I found it. I was too young to be a proper goth, so instead I had to visit castles and watch Bram Stoker’s Dracula. I was really into pre-Raphaelite stuff and put postcards round my room of John William Waterhouse paintings of The Lady of Shalott and Ophelia, which is probably why my mum thought I was a lesbian. Keanu Reeves
I was so in love with him, but I kept it a secret. I thought it was embarrassing to put up a poster of him or [A-ha’s] Morten Harket. But under the bed would be Keanu Reeves folded into tiny pieces. My sister is a brilliant writer and she won a competition where the prize was a year’s subscription to Sight & Sound. I would read it cover to cover in case there was a tiny scrap of information about Reeves buried in one of the essays. So I credit him with all my film knowledge. My General Studies A-level essay was about VFX in Jurassic Park versus practical effects in Dracula. I argued that analogue effects were more uncanny than CGI and I stand by that. I still love Dracula, though I think it loses its way as soon as Anthony Hopkins comes in. Friday night comedy Vic and Bob’s Big Night Out blew my mind, and I loved Morwenna Banks’s Absolutely, but I would watch all sitcoms. So I would sit down and watch Desmond’s and Cheers and Golden Girls and the Brittas Empire and Red Dwarf. Chris Barrie was clean-cut and good looking but I fancied Danny John-Jules. He was just cool. What with the clothes and dandyish aspect, he was sort of the honorary Prince of Red Dwarf. He was also the funniest. I went to see The Mary Whitehouse Experience live. It was like the Beatles; you had to choose one to fancy and of course it was Rob Newman. Kate Bush and Björk
They were these otherworldly creatures who were a validation if you were a slightly dorky girl who was into doing weird drawings. They were chameleonic and mercurial – and their being women and taking authorship of that kind of transformation was amazing. Now there are a billion singers with weird hair who dress like sea creatures, but back then Björk felt unique. A lot of comedians yearn to be musicians; think of Ricky Gervais and Bowie. I did an Edinburgh show based on Kate Bush because I just loved her and wanted to be her. Sometimes, I feel like there’s this agonising one degree of separation between us – and then I’m like, God, I’m just thinking like a stalker. We have a picture of Kate Bush on the wall and once a babysitter came round and mentioned he was in her Hammersmith show. She sometimes talks about doing soundtracks for films and I would obviously die if she did one for my film. Cat Stevens from the charity shop Jethro Tull. Fleetwood Mac. Weird proggy stuff I found in my mum and dad’s record collection or in the charity shop. In the 90s, if you liked folk it was really just Clannad, unless you dug into the 70s to find things you thought magical. Cat Stevens looked like Jesus, so I would listen to him on a loop and cry and be lonely and draw pictures of Medusa.
I never had the money to buy records. So it was always a bit passed-on; secondhand fandom. You had to tape-record the charts. You would go to Woolworths and contemplate for weeks whether to buy an album. I did go to see Blur and Oasis, but because it was sort of the law; my best friends said, “You’ll regret not going.” I was a bit more of a Pulp girl, but Britpop wasn’t quite my time. I was talking to someone recently and they were like, “God, I loved the 90s.” But I didn’t. I had terrible skin and a terrible diet. Most of the time I would sit in my bedroom, listening to vinyl, depressed and eating a vegetable pizza. Eternal Beauty is released on 2 October",2020-09-24 15:55:40,109090

Leoaai Elghareeb is charged with contaminating or interfering with goods with intent at three stores – a Tesco Express, Little Waitrose and Sainsbury’s Local – on Fulham Palace Road. The 37-year-old, from Fulham, did not indicate a plea at Westminster magistrates court on Friday afternoon. The court heard the defendant is alleged to have entered the Waitrose store at 7.30pm on Wednesday with syringes filled with blood. The prosecutor Jennifer Garland said Elghareeb was accused of using the syringes to “inject food items with blood”. The defendant is also accused of doing the same in the nearby Sainsbury’s store, as well as throwing eggs, before going on to inject more items in Tesco Express and then being arrested. Elghareeb was a practising solicitor, the court was told, who ran his own legal consultancy business and was a “man of previous good character”. The precise contents of the blood were not known, the court heard. The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, remanded Elghareeb in custody and said he would appear at Isleworth crown court for a plea hearing on 24 September. Officers in forensics suits were seen in Fulham Palace Road on Thursday, seizing items including processed meats. The officers were seen packing processed meat packs into health hazard bags that were being sent for chemical testing. A petrol station manager on the road on Thursday told reporters: “Police came in and told us to close about 8pm [on Wednesday]. “We only opened about half an hour ago at about 11am. I think it’s the same with anywhere that was open yesterday.” Local authorities and police had investigated whether any other shops had been targeted. After the incident, Hammersmith and Fulham council issued an “emergency alert” notice on its social media accounts on Wednesday evening. Shoppers had been advised to throw away anything bought from the three shops late on Wednesday. It said: “Members of the public are advised as a precaution to dispose of any food items bought from these supermarkets [on Wednesday] evening. “H&F council’s environmental health team are now working with the supermarket branches affected.” The Metropolitan police said in a statement they were called at about 7.40pm to reports of a man shouting abuse at people in the street. “The supermarkets have closed and crime scenes are in place,” the statement had read. “The food items affected are believed to be processed meat and microwaveable products. It is currently unknown as to how many items have been contaminated, or what with. Investigations are ongoing to establish if other businesses in the area are involved in the incident.”",2021-08-27 15:50:42,129582
commentisfree/2022/mar/23/rishi-sunak-spring-statement-2022-panel-verdict,Opinion,Rishi Sunak’s spring statement 2022 – the panel verdict | Miatta Fahnbulleh and others,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/rishi-sunak-spring-statement-2022-panel-verdict,"Miatta Fahnbulleh: Sunak’s support to families facing the cost-of-living crisis is woefully inadequate
As the chancellor stood up today, families up and down the country were facing the worst real-terms income squeeze in 50 years – and inflation has just hit 6.2%. So, did he do enough to ease the cost-of-living crisis facing millions? The verdict is a resounding no. The immediate support to families is woefully inadequate, with too little for the people struggling to afford life’s essentials and too much for those who don’t need it. Only 7% of the benefits of the 5p cut to fuel duty will flow to the bottom fifth of households, compared to 33% for the richest fifth; the increase in the national insurance threshold doesn’t help the poorest and only provides a £250 cash boost to low-and-middle-income families; and the 1p cut in income tax in 2024 is little comfort for families struggling with rising prices today. And any support for families on low incomes has been dwarfed by the combined impact of price hikes and Sunak’s decision to reverse the £20 uplift to universal credit last autumn. And yet there were things he could have done to take the pressure off families. He could have bolstered social security with a £15bn boost to give families at the sharp end of this crisis support worth £4,700 for a working couple with children; he could have opted to put a windfall tax on energy producers’ excess profits to soften the rise in energy prices for millions of families; and he could have invested £12bn in upgrading and insulating our homes, helping millions to reduce the energy they use. Today we needed to see real and decisive action to tackle a crisis that people are dealing with every day – and yet help was thin on the ground, especially for those who needed it most. The chancellor is about to learn that you can’t tax-cut your way out of a cost-of-living crisis; and millions of people are about to pay the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation Katy Balls: This is the start of the Tories’ election campaign
Part of the reason Tory MPs have been so unhappy about the government’s plan to hike national insurance contributions (NICs) next month is that they worry it takes away a key reason to vote Tory at the next election: low taxes. It’s why when Rishi Sunak insists he is is instinctively a low-tax Tory, it tends to be met with scepticism by his colleagues. In the spring statement, he finally put some meat on the bones of his claim. While he refused to axe the NICs rise, his decision to equalise the national insurance and income tax thresholds means that two thirds of voters should be paying less NICs even after the health and social care levy comes in. What’s more, his decision to announce that the basic rate of income tax will be cut in 2024 to 19p offers the clearest sign yet of how the Tories plan to fight that election – and when it will be. Boris Johnson and Sunak had been discussing a pre-election income tax cut privately for some time. Now they have committed to it. Indeed, with Johnson using prime minister’s questions to emphasise the importance of biology in determining someone’s sex and Sunak announcing an income tax cut half an hour later, the Tory campaign appears to be beginning to come into focus. The October budget saw Sunak announce more public spending – something he appeared to do begrudgingly at the behest of the prime minister. He told MPs privately afterwards that in the future, every marginal pound should go on cutting taxes rather than spending. Today’s statement suggests he is getting his way. Will it be enough? The issue for Sunak is that the cost-of-living crisis could get so bad in the time between now and the next election that few will feel all that grateful for a tax cut come 2024 – particularly if it is viewed as largely undoing the pain of the NICs increase. Worryingly, the Office for Budget Responsibility says that inflation will lead to the biggest fall in living standards since records began in 1950. While Sunak cut fuel duty, the measures won’t be enough to stop people feeling pain from this in the coming months. But for a Tory audience, a spring statement that emphasises cutting income tax, careful stewardship of public spending and resilient national finances is reassuring. These are the electoral dividing lines they know how to use. Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor Alice Bell: Climate and energy policy is stuck in the waiting room
The chancellor led with an appeal to motorists and, as many have pointed out, the cut in fuel duty is most likely to benefit an SUV-driving elite. Hardly visionary energy policy rooted in net zero and levelling up. That said, it’s great to see Rishi Sunak explicitly reference energy efficiency, with VAT being cut to zero on energy-saving measures such as loft insulation. It’s nowhere near enough, but suggests the Treasury finally understands the vital role of reducing energy demand. It would be good to see more of this in the long-awaited energy security statement, expected next week. However, this measure is unlikely to help families on lower incomes in the short run. Doubling the household support fund is welcome, especially for the people already struggling to pay gas bills, but it’s a long way from sufficient. Overall, once again, climate and energy policy is stuck in the waiting room. In the meantime, more and more people are being pulled into fuel poverty. Earth’s polar regions are heating up. We don’t have time to wait.

Rishi Sunak’s announcement of a fuel duty cut does very little to help pensioners such as me living in fuel poverty. In fact, it is the wealthiest people who use the most energy for cars and heating, and will benefit most from the cut. The measure does little for those who have reduced their energy usage down to the bone. Everyone ought to have the right to enough energy, free, to cover heating, cooking and lighting. To pay for such a pricing system the government could introduce a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, and put an end to fossil fuel subsidies. We are paying fossil fuel companies huge subsidies and they are increasing inequality, all the while destroying the planet. The chancellor also failed to increase the state pension at a time when prices for everyday items are increasing, leaving people like me struggling to pay for the basics. Our upside-down economy needs a complete rethink. The spring statement shows Sunak was not thinking at all about people in poverty.

commentisfree/2021/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-covid-and-the-nhs-ministers-in-denial-over-a-looming-crisis,Opinion,The Guardian view on Covid and the NHS: ministers in denial over a looming crisis | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-covid-and-the-nhs-ministers-in-denial-over-a-looming-crisis,"Compare and contrast the following sets of statements, the first from Westminster. According to the health secretary, Sajid Javid: “We don’t believe that the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable.” On the contrary, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, says the health service is on course for “gamechanging” investment of nearly £6bn. Meanwhile, the prime minister urges the public to get a booster jab against Covid. That, he says, is “our way through this winter”. From the frontline, the NHS looks very different. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, says A&E departments are “already struggling to cope”, even before we reach the depths of our second Covid winter. The boss of NHS Wales, Dr Andrew Goodall, warns that the next few months will be among the hardest we have ever faced. The country’s most senior gynaecologist, Dr Edward Morris, worries that the coronavirus surge poses a direct threat to maternity wards, with operations cancelled, specialist staff redeployed and an already huge backlog continuing to build. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the politicians live in a parallel universe to NHS professionals. There is more to this than ministers brave-facing it for the TV cameras, examining the few drops at the bottom of the glass and gamely declaring it half full. In the same week that Mr Sunak lays out his spending review, he and his colleagues are drifting into another round of Covid displaying none of the urgency or seriousness it demands. Last week, as almost 50,000 people a day came down with Covid, the cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg laughed off the idea that he might don a face mask in parliament. While the government of which he is part advises face coverings to be worn in crowded places, the leader of the Commons claimed that Conservatives enjoy far too much of a “convivial, fraternal spirit” to comply. None of his cabinet colleagues have so far disavowed that statement, although if case numbers rise it will doubtless be quoted back to them again and again. Throughout this crisis, this government has displayed only a grudging acceptance of mask-wearing, social distancing and the rest of what are termed non-pharmaceutical interventions. Ministers have placed all their eggs in the basket marked “vaccines”, without preparing for what happens when the immunity from serums wears off. And Mr Johnson has always preferred to make handling any crisis a matter for someone else to sort. Petrol shortage? Motorists’ fault. Empty supermarket shelves? Shops should pay staff more. Covid? Personal responsibility. What happens in the meantime or what the role of his government is are questions to be shrugged off. The prime minister will doubtless point to the billions his government is about to pour into the NHS, yet the big problem is that little of it will help with handling Covid. The cash will not be available well after this brutal winter has passed and much of it will be spent on buildings and equipment. Yet the Health Foundation projects that the NHS needs 4,000 more doctors and 17,000 nurses every year just to clear its waiting list of 5.7 million patients. Throughout this pandemic, the government has urged the public to protect the NHS, a reflection of the esteem and affection in which it is held. Now would be a good time for ministers to follow their own advice, by spending the sums that are needed where it will do immediate good and by treating this virus with the seriousness it merits.",2021-10-25 17:59:01,133850
football/2022/jun/27/the-fiver-gareth-bale-usa-usa-usa,Football,The Fiver | An American tale: Gareth Bale goes west,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/27/the-fiver-gareth-bale-usa-usa-usa,"ANOTHER LA STORY “I love going to Los Angeles on holiday,” chirped Gareth Bale in 2020. “I play a lot of golf. I’ve played Pebble [Beach] a couple of times. I played Cypress Point which is a private members’ club which is next to Pebble Beach – that was probably the best course I’ve ever played so far.” Thankfully his latest sojourn to the west coast will allow him to tick off a few more of California’s glorious greens and play the odd football match. Yes, after being linked with every man and his dog, Bale has gone with his head to join LAFC in MLS over hometown club Cardiff City once his Real Madrid contract concludes at the end of the month. “He really wanted to come, the money wasn’t the matter,” sobbed Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. “We came up with what we thought was a good offer to him, but finally it was very hard to compete when there is a lot of big American advertisers, a lot of commercial deals which were very good for Gareth Bale. We tried our best but we failed.” The winger will lead Wales at the Human Rights World Cup in Qatar and fixtures against the Galaxy, Earthquakes and Wizards will ensure Bale remains in peak physical condition. What better way to prepare for a competition in a country that curtails women’s rights and has a lesser interest in football than playing in the USA! USA!! USA!!!? Bale announced the trade, fittingly enough, in the traditional British holiday attire of baseball cap and football shirt while standing on a golf course. No words were offered, just his heart-shaped hand gesture. Start as you mean to go on, Gareth. The move will allow Bale to add a few more things to the list he has more interest in than Real Madrid. Traffic jams, a lack of public infrastructure, stifling heat and being waited on by out-of-work actors. The Wales fans might need a bigger flag for Qatar. QUOTE OF THE DAY “I put our training staff up against anybody.

football/2022/may/25/the-fiver-tin-pot-final-roma-feyenoord,Football,The Fiver | Mourinho and all that is right and wrong with the Conference League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/the-fiver-tin-pot-final-roma-feyenoord,"THE CONSOLATION PRIZE? Let’s hear it for Tin Pot, the third-tier Uefa wheeze that hasn’t turned out to be anywhere near as bad as some thought it would be but still hasn’t quite ended up how those behind it imagined it might. Originally conceived with a view to giving clubs from lesser-ranked leagues around the continent a chance to play in Europe, Tin Pot has done exactly that, even if the somewhat anomalous presence of numerous comparative heavyweights from Europe’s Big Five top flights somewhat kiboshed the chances of anyone from one of those lesser leagues winning the trophy. Having made the inaugural final, Roma more or less sum up everything that is right and wrong about the tournament, what with José Mourinho’s side suffering the acute embarrassment of losing not just once, but twice to Bodø/Glimt from the Arctic Circle, but still surviving to make it to Wednesday’s decider, where they will play Feyenoord, who have just finished third in the Eredivisie. While Feyenoord, with their Big Cup, two Big Vases and one Intercontinental Cup (ask your grandads) have a vastly superior European pedigree to their Italian rivals, Roma have an ace up their sleeve in the form of a Special One who has won each of the four European finals his various teams have contested. Not that he likes to mention it, obviously …
“If I win I will become the first one to win all European trophies, but that’s only if I win,” teased Mourinho, making sure the game is all about him before insisting the game isn’t actually about him. “When you arrive at a final after a season of work, the work is done. It’s the team’s moment, not the moment of an individual.” While he was once fabled for a magic touch that appeared to have deserted him during recent spells at Manchester United, Tottenham and Roma, victory would present Mourinho with an opportunity to flick Vs in the direction of his many critics, even if it does come in a tournament he would almost certainly treat with outright disdain if any other big-name manager won it. “I don’t believe in magical potions, I don’t believe in magical spells,” he said, revealing a hitherto unseen anti-Dumbledore stance. “There’s nothing special to be done, just us to be us as a team. For me, no matter how the final ends, this is a positive season for us.” A comparatively unsuccessful novice, opposite number Arne Slot is all too familiar with Mourinho’s various successes going into the final, but says his Feyenoord players must worry about Roma, rather than their manager’s reputation. “His CV makes you wary of his team,” he tooted. “He is known for winning many finals. But we mainly have to focus on his team, the tactics and the different ways they play. We shouldn’t pay too much attention to the fact that he has such an impressive track record in finals.” They shouldn’t, but if that record improves in Albania with the acquisition of Tin Pot, we can be sure a certain somebody else will turn it into an extremely big deal. QUOTE OF THE DAY “This is agony, absolute agony. I should have told him to go to [Firewall FC]!” – Lord Ferg reluctantly hands over the LMA’s Manager of the Year trophy to Jürgen Klopp and recalls giving him career advice, back in the day, that led him to Liverpool.

Mohamed Salah’s Liverpool contract expires at the end of next season and his future remains up in the air. “In my mind I don’t focus on the contract at the moment,” he negotiated. “I don’t want to be selfish. I’m staying next season for sure.” Fellow Big Cup final-bound forward Karim Benzema isn’t getting hung up on compatriot Kylian Mbappé snubbing Real Madrid. “It’s not the moment to talk about small things,” he honked. “I’m not angry at all.” Burnley are hoping to lure Vincent Kompany back to the north-west of England and make him their new manager. Sevilla have turned their nose up at signing Anthony Martial after being well and truly underwhelmed by his loan. “We spent important money on him and it didn’t work,” sighed chief suit José Castro, bundling the forward on a flight back to Manchester.

us-news/2022/feb/22/us-supreme-court-dakota-access-pipeline,US news,US supreme court rejects Dakota Access pipeline appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-supreme-court-dakota-access-pipeline,"The US supreme court has rejected a case by the Dakota Access oil pipeline operator to avoid a legally mandated environmental review, in a major victory for tribes and environmentalists campaigning to permanently shut down the polluting energy project. Energy Transfer, the pipeline operator, had sought to overturn a legal victory won by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in 2020 that struck down a key federal permit that violated the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). On Tuesday the US supreme court rejected the company’s bid to challenge the 2020 ruling, which required the US army corps of engineers to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact statement (EIS). As a result, the lower court’s decision remains intact and the army corps must complete a review of the pipeline’s route underneath Lake Oahe, which straddles the border of North Dakota and South Dakota, that complies with Nepa. Indigenous communities rely on the lake, which they consider sacred, for drinking water and food. The ruling is a huge victory for North Dakota tribes including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe which rallied support from across the world and sued the US government in a campaign to stop the environmentally risky pipeline being built on tribal lands. It signals the end of the litigation road for the Texan energy company, but the pipeline, known as DAPL and open since 2017, will continue to operate as the review is carried out. “The litigation concerning the pipeline is over, but the fight continues,” said attorney Jan Hasselman from EarthJustice, the legal non-profit that represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the case. “We call on the administration to close the pipeline until a full safety and environmental review is complete. DAPL never should have been authorized in the first place, and this administration is failing to address the persistent illegality of this pipeline,” Hasselman added. The eventual future of the fossil fuel project was not part of the supreme court appeal, but Energy Transfer said in court papers that the pipeline was “vulnerable to a shutdown” with the new environmental review pending. The Standing Rock tribe, along with the Yankton Sioux, the Oglala Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, have long opposed the biggest pipeline out of the Bakken shale basin, which runs about 1,170 miles from North Dakota to Illinois. The disputed section under Lake Oahe, an artificial reservoir on the Missouri River, is 1.7 miles long. The tribes fear an oil spill which could be catastrophic. The legal battle dates back to 2016 when the Obama administration denied permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri river and ordered a full EIS to analyze alternative routes and the impact on the tribe’s treaty rights. In his first week in office, Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite construction. Construction of the 1,200-mile pipeline was completed in June 2017. The tribe challenged the permits – and won. As a result, the corps was ordered to redo its environmental analysis, which it did without taking into consideration tribal concerns or expert analysis. The pipeline continued to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The tribes and EarthJustice, an environmental law not-for-profit group, sued again. In March 2020, federal judge James Boasberg, an Obama appointee, said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the corps was severely lacking. In his ruling, Boasberg said that the company’s abysmal safety record of the pipeline parent company “does not inspire confidence”. The Biden administration urged the supreme court not to hear the subsequent appeal by Energy Transfer, saying the pipeline operator concerns about a shutdown were overstated. The company declined to comment.",2022-02-22 18:33:52,141534

The Times says “West imposes sanctions as Biden warns of war” and carries an image of Russian troops and tanks in the Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine. It reports the US president’s comment that Russia’s military is moving blood supplies to the border, and disquiet among some senior Tory figures over the extent of the UK sanctions.
The Express takes a more critical stance of UK sanctions. The headline is: “Punish Putin harder now”. It says Boris Johnson has been urged to move swiftly to punish up to 150 oligarchs linked to Vladimir Putin or face a “global catastrophe”.
The Mirror agrees, saying “Get dirty Russian money out of UK now”. It calls the UK sanctions “feeble” and says MPs and activists are urging more effort to halt Russian money laundering in the UK.
Metro says “We’ll grab him by the roubles”, alongside cutout images of the prime minister and Putin. It carries a hint of discontent at the extent of the sanctions but is broadly positive about the “first barrage” of measures.
The Guardian focuses on the latest developments abroad, with the headline: “Threat of war grows as Putin backs Ukraine proxy states” and a huge image of Russian tanks ploughing through the mud close to Ukraine’s border. It gives prominence to Biden’s comments and Germany’s decision to put the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia on hold.
The Telegraph gives the US president the headline – “Putin is invading and will go much further, says Biden” – and Johnson the main image. It notes the potential for millions to suffer as a result of the invasion, Nord Stream 2 and Putin expanding Moscow’s claims beyond Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine.
The Mail takes a more visceral approach with “Twisted Putin is ready for bloodshed”. It notes Russian tank movements and says 100 Nato jets are on alert.
The FT concentrates on the growing risk of war after Putin recognised expanded territorial claims beyond areas already under Russian control in Ukraine. The headline is: “Putin backs separatist claims to whole Donbas region of Ukraine”.
“Putin takes Europe to brink of war”, says the i, with bullet points on the west’s sanctions packages and growing fears of a full-scale invasion.
The Sun reports that the UK is posed to send more weapons to Ukraine and Johnson’s comments about Putin’s “illogical and irrational frame of mind”. The headline is: Boris: stop mad Vlad”.",2022-02-23 03:17:13,141476
football/2021/jul/23/kim-little-relishing-japan-test-after-nutmegs-get-her-trending-on-twitter,Football,Kim Little relishing Japan test after nutmegs get her trending on Twitter | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/23/kim-little-relishing-japan-test-after-nutmegs-get-her-trending-on-twitter,"The Team GB midfielder Kim Little is not on Twitter. She did not know she was trending on Wednesday. She did not know clips of her nutmegs and silky play in the side’s opening game of the Olympics against Chile were doing the rounds on social media. “I haven’t seen any of them – I can remember them,” the 31-year-old Arsenal midfielder said with a wry smile. “It’s nice to hear that people enjoyed my performance but mostly the team’s and I’m just happy that I’m able to bring my strengths to the squad and hope that it helps us win games.”
Little has been here before; not literally here, in Sapporo, but at the Olympics. She was one of two Scots in the squad for the London Olympics in 2012 alongside the Ifeoma Dieke. Little has played for big clubs in some of the biggest leagues and is no stranger to this stage, but it does not feel like a business trip. “Part of what we do for a living is play football to get results, so there’s always that element of getting the job done,” she said before captaining Team GB in their second group game at the Sapporo Dome on Saturday against Japan. “Being able to express ourselves and do it for a living at an Olympics is the ultimate. As much as it is business to a certain extent, in that we’re here to win matches and to win the tournament, it’s very much an enjoyable one.” Little and her fellow Scot in this incarnation of Team GB, Manchester City’s Caroline Weir, formed a formidable midfield with City’s Keira Walsh anchoring them. Little has played with a number of the squad with Arsenal and previously with Team GB, and Weir has Little and nine City teammates to help make the transition into a majority English team seamless. “The way we play football makes it quite easy to connect with each other on the pitch and see each other’s runs and combine movements quite well,” said Little. “It’s been great to play with new players and some of the best in the world and we’re all thriving off that and hoping we can get better and better throughout the tournament. “I don’t think I’ve played with someone as fast as Lauren [Hemp]. As a midfielder I’m quite central and I think as soon as she has space and is wide then my role is to get the ball to her one-on-one and then maybe to move away to give her space and not always go to her. We did that well [against Chile]. Those connections with Lauren and other players is what makes what we do so fun.”
Weir says that pre-existing connections have helped her settle. “I feel lucky that a lot of Man City teammates are here, [plus] Kim, and I’ve played with pretty much everyone else apart from maybe Fran [Kirby], Millie [Bright], Rach [Daly],” she said. Team GB return to the enclosed Sapporo Dome – which Weir describes as “one of the coolest places I’ve ever played”, in part because she “loved it that it wasn’t hot” – to face a very different challenge from the one posed by Chile. Japan will not have the benefit of a home crowd but Little said: “All footballers would say they’d much rather play with a crowd regardless of whether they are for you or against you, so of course that’s a big miss with this tournament.” The team have reviewed games against Japan, whom Little and Weir faced at the 2019 World Cup. “It was a very tough game for us and we need to be as prepared as possible for that, especially with them being the home nation and having such great technical ability,” Little said.
“I like the challenge of playing again all different types of players, whether it’s physical attributes, speed or technical. Japan, probably more than most, have a general theme throughout, whereas our team is full of strengths in so many areas and I hope we can use that to help us be successful.” Do this Team GB side feel they can go a long way? “I think so,” said Weir. “We’re trying not to think too far ahead. We know we have talent – it’s such a competitive squad. There’s going to be probably quite a bit of rotation just because we have the squad to do that and the games are going to come thick and fast.”",2021-07-23 16:12:07,128473
us-news/2022/feb/28/us-new-covid-vaccinations-decline-cases-hospitalizations-drop,US news,New Covid vaccinations drop in US as cases and hospitalizations decline,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/us-new-covid-vaccinations-decline-cases-hospitalizations-drop,"On some days Marilyn Datillo, a vaccine nurse, used to see 900 people enter Mercy Covid Vaccine Clinic in Kirkwood, a St Louis suburb. Now, she said sometimes fewer than 20 people visit the clinic in one day – even though only 55% of Missouri residents are fully vaccinated and just 22% are boosted. When someone does show up to get vaccinated, “you celebrate”, Datillo said. But she and infectious disease doctors do not anticipate many more people suddenly deciding to get their first shot – or ending delays on second shots and boosters – amid declining numbers of Covid cases and hospitalizations in the US; the lifting of vaccine mandates and other restrictions; and some talk of the end of the pandemic being in view. The number of new people getting vaccinated in America has steadily declined in recent months, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. The seven-day average of new vaccinations now mirrors the rates from December 2020, when there was a limited supply of the vaccines. But doctors emphasize that the virus remains a threat in the US and that people who are not vaccinated are at greater risk of become severely ill or dying. They point to the fact that the seven-day average of new cases on 23 February in the United States was 76,667, according to the New York Times data. On 23 February last year, the seven-day average was 67,854. The seven-day average of deaths on those dates were also not much different: 1,908 and 2,056. “I can think back to just last week when I had to put someone on a breathing machine who was unvaccinated, so this continues to be with us,” said Dr Anuj Mehta, a pulmonologist with Denver Health in Colorado, where 69% of people are fully vaccinated and 34% boosted. Even though the number of cases and hospitalizations have plummeted since the height of the Omicron surge, Mehta continues to worry because new variants will emerge “until we get the entire world vaccinated”, he said. “I could imagine a time this summer or fall” when people who “tested positive for Covid in the last three months will think that they have ongoing immunity, and I think that’s not true”, said Mehta. But Mehta admits that he is unsure whether it’s realistic that the whole world will get vaccinated. He said he is encouraged by the development of a new Covid vaccine that does not need to be stored at as low temperature as existing ones and thus could make it easier to vaccinate much of the world. “We need to push forward on that and help as a global community member to achieve that goal, which in turn will help protect the United States,” said Mehta. Dr Farrin Manian, an infectious disease specialist and chair of the department of medicine at Mercy Hospital St Louis, conceded that there are people who aren’t going to change their minds about vaccination. But in talking with patients, he still encounters some who are open to it. “I think we just need to talk about what has happened in the last year and hopefully get people to change their minds and honestly discuss the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing hospitalizations,” said Manian. Mehta also thinks there could be more opportunities for conversations about the vaccines because so many people skipped primary care during the pandemic and will hopefully now return to see their doctors. A January poll from the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation found that among older adults, only about half of the unvaccinated had rescheduled a primary care appointment that was disrupted by the pandemic in 2021, compared with 85% of those who were boosted and 74% of those who were vaccinated. “We would have a slight increase in the rates of boosting and vaccines in general if people were to have a real conversation with an individual provider,” said Mehta. “Seeing patients in the clinic with lung disease, I am far more likely to convince somebody to get the vaccine when I am talking to them in person.” “When I ask them why they don’t want to, they cite everything they see on Facebook, and I am able to counter that in an individual appointment, when they are there to check in on their asthma or their COPD,” he added. Datillo, the vaccine nurse, still encounters people who decided to get vaccinated only after losing a loved one who also wasn’t vaccinated. And people who didn’t get a vaccine because they were concerned about its impact on their ability to have children. Or people who initially didn’t get a booster because, they said, “I got Covid anyway, and I was sick, so why bother getting the booster?” Datillo is, of course, only seeing them because they eventually decided to get the shot, but most people’s “judgement has been made”, she said. If that’s the case, people who have not gotten a booster or people whose immunity from an infection has waned could “become more susceptible to severe disease”, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. “I do think it’s of the utmost importance that we keep an eye on the virus over the summer and don’t assume that everything that’s going to happen is in the rearview mirror.”",2022-02-28 10:00:41,140403
commentisfree/2021/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-starmers-labour-time-to-take-on-the-tories,Opinion,The Guardian view on Starmer’s Labour: time to take on the Tories | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-starmers-labour-time-to-take-on-the-tories,"Britons usually eat more than 10m turkeys during the festive season. If the country were to run short of the yuletide bird then that may be the crisis to crystallise for voters Boris Johnson’s leading role in letting down the public. Mr Johnson has gone to extraordinary lengths to deny his complicity in failure. Yet his fingerprints are all over recent upheavals: the panic buying of petrol, the empty supermarket shelves, working people facing steep cuts in benefits. Leaving the EU has allowed the government to make mistakes and Mr Johnson has embraced this freedom with gusto. During Covid, British lorry drivers failed to get the message about a Brexit dividend of wage hikes and left their jobs. Ministers have been forced to ask European workers to make up the shortfall and save Christmas for the country that claimed it no longer needed them. No one ought to believe an inveterate liar. The fact that many Labour voters who backed Mr Johnson still give him the benefit of the doubt lies at the heart of Sir Keir Starmer’s electoral problem. The prime minister dodged the blame for his catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic by spinning it as a story of vaccine success. In a crisis, there are two narratives in play at the same time. One is that a country is about to go off the rails. The other, Mr Johnson’s preferred oratorical territory, is that this is an opportunity to wake up a nation’s potential. Labour’s conundrum can be encapsulated in its educational divide. The party holds a majority of the constituencies with both the most and the least graduates. A market exists for a stinging critique of Mr Johnson’s competence but also for Mr Johnson’s claim to fight against an establishment that has let the country down. Sir Keir needs a message that is both combative and hopeful. The prime minister’s lexicon, such as “levelling up”, is designed to facilitate claims of political success not deal with the real challenges. Overlaying a map that showed communities with the lowest healthy life expectancies with one highlighting the borders of the “red wall” would find they aligned closely in 2019. It seems that will still be the case when the next election comes. Sir Keir has a short window to pin responsibility for the overlapping crises of the pandemic, the economy, social justice and the climate on to Mr Johnson. That will require an analysis of why the economic model shaped by Mr Johnson and his predecessors is in deep trouble. The Labour leader has dusted off some crowd-pleasing policies from the past, such as ending tax breaks for private schools. But Sir Keir seems unwilling to see the pandemic as a political turning point. This decision may be a costly mistake. Having conference delegates vote for public ownership of energy companies hours after Sir Keir said he would not bodes ill for his leadership. Sir Keir’s writ does not extend to his ambitious deputy, Angela Rayner, who attacked Mr Johnson in terms that the Labour leader was uncomfortable with but unable to do anything about. He has begun his week looking like a king without a court, at odds with leading figures on the left such as Ed Miliband on nationalisation and those on the right such as Rachel Reeves on the issue of taxation. Covid has denied Sir Keir opportunities to connect with voters. The Labour leader has not helped himself by wasting time by fighting, and losing, an internal battle over how the next leader is elected. Labour faces existential implications if it suffers a historic fifth election defeat. Sir Keir must know that more is at stake than just his own leadership this week.",2021-09-26 16:53:24,131596
politics/2022/may/23/unionists-react-with-scorn-as-us-delegation-arrives-in-ireland-brexit,UK news,‘One-sided’: unionists react with scorn as US delegation arrives in Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/unionists-react-with-scorn-as-us-delegation-arrives-in-ireland-brexit,"Unionists have responded with scorn and scepticism to a US congressional delegation that is attempting to shore up support for the Northern Ireland protocol. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) led accusations on Monday that the nine-strong delegation, which includes Democrats and Republicans from the House of Representatives and Senate, was partisan and out of touch. “We’re dealing with more American politicians who are one-sided,” Gordon Lyons, an economy minister in the mothballed Stormont executive, told the BBC. “We’re going to have a particular challenge with Congressman Neal,” he said, referring to Richard Neal, the chair of the ways and means committee. Others such as Jamie Bryson, a prominent loyalist, went further and accused Neal, an ally of President Joe Biden, of supporting the IRA. “We aren’t going to be dictated to by some foreign politician acting as a surrogate for republicanism,” he tweeted. The American visitors are in Ireland at the end of a six-day trip to Europe that included meetings with the EU’s Brexit commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, in Brussels and the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in London.
The visit has been dominated by the protocol, a part of the UK’s 2019 divorce treaty with the EU which avoided imposing a trade and customs border on the island of Ireland by placing it in the Irish Sea. Unionist leaders say it damages the economy and undermines the region’s position in the UK. The Americans have advised London not to unilaterally rip up parts of the protocol, saying that would violate the Good Friday agreement, which underpins peace in Northern Ireland, and wreck any potential trade deal with the US. “I think it’s best whenever there is a difference of view to sit down across the table and negotiate towards a common purpose. That is the history we celebrate when we think about the benefits of the Good Friday agreement,” the Democratic congressman Dan Kildee told RTÉ. The delegation met the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, and the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, on Monday. Both lauded the visitors, reflecting a united front between Dublin and Washington on the protocol. “Negotiation, not unilateral action, the way forward,” Martin tweeted.
On Tuesday Neal is to address the Seanad, the upper chamber of the Irish parliament. The delegation is scheduled to meet DUP leaders before returning to the US on Wednesday. It promises to be a frosty encounter. In public and private, unionists have accused the Americans of refusing to recognise that the protocol is rejected by most unionists and thus undermines the Good Friday agreement. On Sunday Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said the delegation’s call for full implementation of the protocol was folly. “Implementing the protocol in full means ending grace periods, with an economic tsunami hitting Northern Ireland. Power-sharing only works with cross-community consensus.” The DUP has thwarted the formation of an executive and assembly at Stormont in protest at the protocol.",2022-05-23 17:30:33,147740

books/2021/aug/29/forget-the-alamo-review-texas-slavery-mexico-burrough-tomlinson-stanford,Books,Forget the Alamo review: dark truths of the US south and its ‘secular Mecca’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/29/forget-the-alamo-review-texas-slavery-mexico-burrough-tomlinson-stanford,"As the ancient American struggle over how much truth to tell about the traditional oppression of minorities bubbles over, with arguments over everything from the teaching of critical race theory to the mention of anything gay in the presence of anyone under 18, this engaging new book about the history of the Alamo arrives at the perfect moment.
Or, as Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson and Jason Stanford assert: “If there’s ever been a moment for a spirited discussion about what the Alamo really symbolizes, we’d suggest it’s now.” Burrough is the author of six books; Tomlinson an accomplished journalist; Stanford a successful political consultant. In their collective opinion, it’s “not an overstatement to say the Alamo is the secular western wall” of Texas, “its secular Mecca. Somewhat as Jews and Muslims have struggled over the Temple Mount, so Anglos, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Tejanos and Native Americans are now debating the future of the Alamo and its meaning.” Almost 200 years after the battle which killed 200 Americans at an old Spanish church outside San Antonio, the essential argument remains the same: were these settlers fighting for their “freedom” against the oppression of a Mexican tyrant, Antonio López de Santa Anna, or were they mostly interested in preserving the slavery a recently independent Mexico opposed but they considered essential for the success of their burgeoning cotton farms? Burrough, Tomlinson and Stanford leave no doubt about the correct answer. Slavery. “Texas as we know it exists only because of slave labor,” they assert, and most Texans who came from the the south “wouldn’t immigrate to Texas without it … for Mexicans, newly freed from Spanish oppression, abolishing slavery was a moral issue. For the American colonists it was an issue of wealth creation.” Or as the Texas pioneer Stephen Austin wrote in different letters, “Nothing is wanted but money” and “negroes are necessary to make it”. What the authors call a “historiography” or “a history of histories” does a fine job of separating the few actual facts about the Alamo from the legend which comprises “the beating heart of Texas exceptionalism”. Jim Bowie, portrayed in countless histories and movies as one of the Alamo’s most valiant defenders, most likely died in his sickbed without engaging any attacker. Davey Crockett, always depicted in paintings, songs and movies dying “at the center of a ring of fallen Mexican soldiers”, most likely surrendered in the middle of the battle and was executed afterwards. Whether it was a fight for liberty or for slavery, the Alamo was an overwhelming victory for Mexico. But accounts of Mexican butchery – anyone who surrendered was executed and their body immediately burned – spurred a huge desire for revenge. “It’s not an overstatement,” the authors write, “to venture that the gently massaged story of [the Alamo’s] heroic fall emerged as the single most powerful weapon in [future Texas president Sam] Houston’s arsenal.” Just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo, Santa Anna’s army was attacked by Houston’s men and defeated in 18 minutes at the battle of San Jacinto. Six hundred Mexicans were killed. Only nine Texans died in the battle, plus six who succumbed to their wounds. The rest of the book is devoted to the long battle waged by historians, novelists and movie-makers, all seeking to use this history for their own purposes. DW Griffith, auteur of The Birth of a Nation, “the most racist blockbuster film in US history”, was also responsible for its spiritual sequel, Martyrs of the Alamo, “the most perversely distorted version of the Alamo narrative ever told … It portrays the Texas revolt as an Anglo revolt against the sexual predations of Santa Anna and his soldiers. Forget liberty, forget Mexican tyranny, [according to Griffith] the Alamo was actually about the perils of miscegenation.” A particularly poignant section of Burrough, Tomlinson and Stanford’s book offers the accounts of Mexican-American Texans who considered themselves American until the seventh grade – when they suddenly discovered they were the murderers of the Alamo. The Latina activist Rosie Castro, the mother of presidential candidate Julían and his congressman brother Joaquin, remembered it this way.
“They used to take us there when we were schoolchildren. They told us how glorious that battle was. When I grew up I learned that the ‘heroes’ of the Alamo were a bunch of drunks and cooks and slaveholding imperialists who conquered land that didn’t belong to them. But as a little girl I got the message – we were losers. I can truly say that I hate that place and everything it stands for.” Incredibly, the three authors write that they “couldn’t find a single white friend who knew of this widespread Latino sentiment. This ignorance, we might venture, lies at the root of much of the resistance toward updating the Alamo narrative.” They conclude that most people “need to forget what we learned about the Alamo, embrace the truth and celebrate all Texans”. Reading their book is a terrific first step on that essential journey. Forget the Alamo is published in the US by Penguin",2021-08-29 06:00:09,129337
money/2022/jan/29/covid-tests-travellers-from-england-and-scotland-face-new-rules,Money,Covid tests: travellers from England and Scotland face new rules,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/covid-tests-travellers-from-england-and-scotland-face-new-rules,"International travel will receive its biggest boost in two years when the government scraps the need to be Covid tested before and after you arrive back home in England or Scotland – provided you are fully vaccinated or under 18. The rule change, which comes just in time for the half-term break, applies to anyone arriving after 4am on Friday 11 February. Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow. Under-18s and those who qualify as fully vaccinated (having had the second jab at least 14 days previously) will no longer need to take a Covid test before they depart for home, nor after they arrive back.
On the same day, the unvaccinated will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival but they will still need to take a pre-departure test, and book and pay for a day-two PCR test. The need for the second, day-eight, test is removed. Everyone arriving in the UK will still be required to fill in a passenger locator form. Those heading abroad face a bewildering set of rules – depending on their destination.
Most countries now require a vaccination certificate to enter without quarantine and, or, a negative Covid-19 test result taken up to 48 hours before the traveller departs the UK. Some countries require the under-18s to prove they have been vaccinated or that adults have had a booster. In Austria, 16- and 17-year-olds must be fully vaccinated, take a test and have a booster in order to enter. Malta still requires 12- to 18-year-olds to be fully vaccinated before arrival. For this reason, the UK government has announced that children aged 12-15 are to be given access to digital Covid passes in time for half-term. Families can also request a NHS Covid pass letter, which takes about seven working days to arrive.
Plenty of people who have had the coronavirus in the previous three months are returning positive results when they take pre-departure PCR tests. Some countries, for example, Morocco, which reopens to tourists on 1 February, currently require a negative PCR test taken up to 48 hours before departure. It is worth considering whether all your party would pass a test before you book an expensive trip. PCR tests will pick up traces of infection up to three months after it ended. Some countries will accept proof of recovery instead of a negative PCR test but not many. It is expected that more countries will relax rules in the coming weeks and months but you may not want to bank upon it.",2022-01-29 12:00:02,138844
us-news/2021/dec/21/kyle-rittenhouse-turning-point-usa-standing-ovation,US news, Conservative event gives Rittenhouse a standing ovation a month after acquittal,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/kyle-rittenhouse-turning-point-usa-standing-ovation,"A month after his acquittal on murder charges, Kyle Rittenhouse was given a standing ovation at a conservative conference in Phoenix on Monday night, as panelists discussed events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020, when the teen shot three men.
The event, called AmericaFest, was held by Turning Point USA, a young conservatives group. As Rittenhouse took the stage, thousands of cheering fans chanted his name, along with his own theme song, adapted from his name. Hosts asked if any women in the crowd wanted to go on a date with Rittenhouse, prompting loud cheers. One audience member held a “Kiss me” sign, according to one spectator. Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, praised Rittenhouse, telling him: “You’re a hero to millions, it’s an honor to be able to have you.” On stage, Rittenhouse, 18, reflected on how his trial matured him and discussed his decision to testify in his own defense. “I think my trial was an example of them trying to come after our second amendment rights, a right to defend ourselves, in trying to take weapons,” he said. In Kenosha last August, during a Black Lives Matters racial justice protest, Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, when he shot them with an assault rifle as he roamed the streets with other armed men acting as a self-described militia. The protest followed the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back by a white police officer, which left Blake partially paralyzed. In Phoenix on Monday, security guards ejected a journalist for asking Rittenhouse questions “too aggressively”. The independent journalist, Elad Eliahu, asked: “Excuse me, Mr Rittenhouse, can you tell me why you support” Black Lives Matter. Rittenhouse has said that he does. According to Eliahu, security officials “wrapped me up and removed me from the conference”. A Turning Point spokesperson said Eliahu “rushed Kyle a little too aggressively” and “he is for sure not coming back to AmericaFest”. Rittenhouse’s acquittal in November came after a trial that gripped America. Though the men Rittenhouse shot were also white, the trial was seen by many as a litmus test of the country’s racial divide. To such observers, events in the courtroom appeared to illustrate contrasting attitudes of law enforcement when confronted with white men claiming to be acting as vigilante-style informal security personnel, armed with assault rifles, and Black members of the public or BLM protesters. Rittenhouse has emerged as a mascot among Republicans. Writing in the Washington Post, Eddie Glaude, chairman of Princeton University’s department of African American studies, said many on the right regard Rittenhouse as the “poster child for a general feeling among some in this country that white America is under siege”. He added: “Rittenhouse defended himself, this argument goes, and white America must do the same.” • The sub-heading of this article was amended on 10 January 2022 to correctly refer to Kenosha, Wisconsin, not “Kenosha, Washington”.",2021-12-21 17:07:49,137990
football/2022/jun/23/lucy-bronze-lyon-and-barcelona-offers-england,Football,"Lucy Bronze: ‘I had offers from Lyon and Barça, the world’s best teams’",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/23/lucy-bronze-lyon-and-barcelona-offers-england,"After Lucy Bronze signed for Barcelona last Saturday, her phone pinged. It was Alexia Putellas, who succeeded Bronze as Fifa’s best player of the year. “Alexia texted me saying she’s so excited to play with me on the team,” Bronze says. “Things like that give you huge confidence when players want to play with you and teams want you. Who doesn’t like being told they’re good? It gives you confidence and confidence plays a huge role in how you perform.”
Bronze’s return to Manchester City after a trophy-laden spell with Lyon had not been quite the fairytale the right-back had perhaps hoped. In two years in Manchester, some of which was blighted by injury, she won the FA Cup shortly after her return and the Continental League Cup last season. The dream of winning the Champions League with City seemed as far off as it did when she left for Lyon: they crashed out in the second round against to Real Madrid last season and lost in the quarter-finals to Barcelona the season before. Last month, after City scraped past Manchester United into the third Champions League place after a terrible start put them out of the title race before it had properly begun, Bronze’s agent’s phone was ringing. “I had offers from Lyon and Barça, the two best teams in the world,” she says. “It wasn’t bad to be able to pick from that. It gives me loads of confidence knowing that these big teams who are so successful want to sign me, want me to play, know that I can make a difference to their team.” It was not a wrench to leave the Women’s Super League again. “I didn’t really think about it, to be honest,” she says. “I knew I wanted to play abroad again. My experience at Lyon was the best time in my career, the best moments of my career. “Going out and pushing myself into a different culture, a different experience, playing with the world’s best players – to have the chance to do that again was a no-brainer.
“Maybe I can’t hype doing the same experience again with Barça but I would love to because that was the greatest experience of my life. I’ve not had an experience in England quite the same.” Having the deal in place before the home Euros was important. “It was pretty much done the week after the end of the season; I just had to find the time to sort it all out. It was hard keeping my mouth shut because it was so exciting. “The one thing I said to Barça and my agent was that I wanted it done before the tournament – get it done, get it out the way. I want to be able to focus on England; I don’t want questions about what club you’re going to next and all the talk and the gossip around that.” Success with England matters. It is the blank space on Bronze’s career hitlist. She is a winner and now, with the former Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman at the helm, England have an experienced, winning manager. “Having an experience of winning is second to none,” says Bronze. “You go back to club football, the Champions League final between Lyon and Barça – everyone picked Barça but it was Lyon with [Amandine] Henry that has got that mentality to just pick up the game and go for it. Winning is a priceless experience and myself and Sarina both have that in heaps.” Henry’s Lyon teammate and fellow serial winner Ada Hegerberg makes England’s Group A rivals Norway potential contenders, Bronze says.
“Ada is just a winner, the girl is crazy in that respect. I can remember games where she’d come up to me beforehand and say: ‘You just get the ball in the box and I’ll score.’ She’s just obsessed with scoring, she’s obsessed with wanting to win the ball. “There’s not many No 9s who can score goals and then will get back and make tackles and put their body on the line. She’s so tall and she’s got pace and strength, fitness. “The thing that separates her, for me, is that crazy mentality she’s got; it’s something you can’t really affect. You can’t really get in her head – I might try.” England are contenders, too, and expectations are rising as we edge towards the opening game against Austria at Old Trafford on 6 July. For Bronze, an unused sub in the 2013 Euros as England failed to escape their group, time has moved quickly. “It’s so different. Me and Jordan [Nobbs] were the two babies of the team – we didn’t really speak,” she says. “We got sent some Nike boots. Hardly any of the players were sponsored so no one had any boots, which is funny because I’ve just been outside with all the kids from the grassroots clubs [who were watching training at St George’s Park] and they were asking for boots. I just gave them to them because I can get boots whenever I want. But back then we got sent these boots from Nike. All we did was give our size. We didn’t get to pick anything else, no names on them. “They came up a little bit too small on us. Me and Jordan didn’t dare ask for a different pair, so we wore boots the whole time that were too small for us. We’d get in trouble if we even thought about doing that now. It makes me laugh because nowadays we have the guy from Nike come in and he measures your feet and makes sure they fit like a glove. “That first Euros it was like: ‘You get what you’re given girls and you crack on,’ and we did.”",2022-06-23 09:44:05,149488

Thanks to Charles Dickens writing about it and Bing Crosby singing about it, snowy scenes have become synonymous with Christmas, but in the UK at least the chances of waking up to a thick blanket of snow are very slim. The Met Office defines a white Christmas to be at least one snowflake observed falling in the 24 hours of Christmas Day, somewhere in the UK. On average, just over half of all Christmas Days in the UK turn out to be a “white Christmas”, but a single flake in Edinburgh probably isn’t what most of us have in mind. The Dickensian scene of widespread snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day has occurred only four times in the UK since 1960 – in 1981, 1995, 2009 and 2010. Christmas in 2010 was particularly unusual, with snow on the ground at 83% of weather stations; the highest ever recorded. White Christmases were more common during the 18th and 19th centuries, with North Atlantic regions still in the grip of the little ice age. And prior to 1752, when Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar and lopped 11 days off the year, the chances of a white Christmas were even higher. But in recent decades global heating has lengthened the odds of a white Christmas.",2021-12-21 06:00:06,138085

Presidium Network, a UK-based company that says it carries out evacuations of families and individuals from war zones, identified Paul Urey and Dylan Healy as the captured men. The Foreign Office (FCDO) said earlier on Friday it was seeking further information about claims the two men who went to Ukraine to provide humanitarian aid have been captured. A statement from Urey’s mother, Linda, released by Presidium said: “My family and I are extremely worried. We know my son Paul and his friend who was a humanitarian aid volunteer in Ukraine has been captured by the Russians. “He was out there on his own accord. We want everyone’s support to bring my son home and pray he is safe. “My son Paul is also type 1 diabetic and needs his insulin. We have asked the Presidium Network to help us and also the FCDO to help as well. We pray for him and hope he is safe.” The company said it had been intending to work with the men, who were missing south of Zaporizhzhia, and provided details of messages in which they had reported their location. Both appeared to be members of the public with little or no experience of military or humanitarian work. There was no immediate comment from the FCDO. “The Foreign Office is doing all it can to support and identify these two people,” the British trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, told Sky News. The Institute for the Study of War thinktank, warned this week that Russian forces were stepping up operations to abduct Ukrainian citizens for use in prisoner exchanges. On Thursday, the Foreign Office confirmed that a British citizen had been killed in Ukraine and a second was missing, amid reports that both were volunteers who had gone to fight in the country. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former soldier who had served overseas. Ex-colleagues paid tribute on a Facebook page run by veterans of the commandos logistics support squadron, where he was described as a man who had “showed commando spirit until the end”.
Sibley is believed to be the first British fighter known to have been killed in combat in Ukraine. A small number of serving British personnel are understood to have gone absent without leave to join the resistance against the Russian invasion, while veterans and Britons without combat experience are thought to have also travelled to Ukraine. There was initially confusion about the government’s position after the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in comments during an interview to the BBC on 26 February, said she would “absolutely” support UK nationals who chose to fight for Ukraine. The Facebook page where tributes were paid to Sibley posted what was understood to be a photo of him while serving in the military in his younger days. He is seen in uniform, standing at what appears to be Bagram airfield in Afghanistan. • This article was amended on 3 May 2022.

For years she has made a living as a migrant farm worker, where she can earn several times what she would in her home country. Last year she applied to become part of the UK government’s seasonal worker visa scheme, picking fruit and vegetables on a farm in Herefordshire that supplies fresh produce to Marks & Spencer (M&S), Tesco and Waitrose. Ditya got the job, but it came at a huge cost. In order to secure it, she says she had to pay more than £3,000 – almost a third of what she earned during the six-month post – to recruitment agents. Some of that money covered the cost of her flight and visa application. The rest appears to include illegal fees that labour rights experts describe as “exploitative and extortionate”. A joint investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Guardian can reveal that as many as 150 Nepali workers who came to work at Cobrey Farms in Herefordshire as part of the government scheme may have paid similar amounts, many of them claiming they paid agents working for a UK-licensed recruitment company. The findings suggest that the underfunding of labour-rights enforcement, combined with the rapid expansion of the seasonal worker scheme – which aims to plug shortages created by Brexit and Covid-19 – could be putting thousands of migrant labourers at risk of exploitation.
Tesco and M&S, which buy from Cobrey, have human rights policies requiring their suppliers to ensure workers are not charged fees. Tesco and M&S said they are urgently investigating the matter. Tesco added that any illegal fees had to be repaid in full. The workers, however, say they have not yet been reimbursed. A Waitrose spokesperson said it couldn’t comment on the specific case, which was a live investigation, but it would “take whatever action” was needed. The UK government launched the seasonal workers pilot scheme in 2019 to address concerns that the withdrawal from the EU would cause a shortage of labour for harvesting jobs on farms. Its rules state that workers should only pay a visa application fee of £259 (£244 until April this year) and travel costs. Any additional recruitment fees are illegal under UK law and can result in a labour provider being stripped of its licence. Workers speaking on condition of anonymity said that they paid the fees to agents working for the Nepali company My Careers HR Solutions, which Poseidon Human Capital, a recruitment firm headquartered in London, says it controls day-to-day. Poseidon had in turn been hired by the Brighton-based charity Concordia, one of four organisations that operate the UK government scheme. Concordia had been contracted to find workers to pick fruit and vegetables at Cobrey Farms. Simon Bowyer, CEO of Concordia, said that his company conducted an investigation and interviewed more than half of the 150 people recruited to work at the farm by Poseidon. He said a “significant percentage” told them they had paid fees to My Careers HR Solutions, its chairman John Khadka, Poseidon or “other named associates”, and that most payments were between RS300,000 (£1,935) and RS750,000 (£4,840). Poseidon director Matthew Hurley said the company hired its own investigators, from a “reputable law firm”, who found that no officers from his company had been complicit in illegal fees being taken. The costs for a Nepali worker to participate in the scheme, including charges for preparing documents, visa costs and logistics, are estimated to be more than £2,000, Hurley said. If farms covered these costs, potential “exposure to payment of illicit fees would be eradicated”, he said. Khadka, who was the chairman of Kathmandu-based My Careers HR Solutions at the time of the alleged breaches, said the investigation found two deposits made by workers to his accounts. He said that both were from longtime friends who he was helping to transfer money. In March, Khadka denied that his company had recruited Nepali workers to the UK or that he had any dealings with Poseidon. He subsequently said that he was suspended from the My Careers HR Solutions board as a result of Poseidon’s investigation, but added that it found the allegations made against him to be “incorrect”. Concordia has now terminated its relationship with Poseidon and alerted the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), the government body in charge of licensing labour providers and tackling exploitation in the agriculture sector. A spokesperson for the GLAA said it does not “provide a running commentary on specific investigations”. The charging of recruitment fees via third parties has resulted in thousands of Nepali workers – primarily working in the Gulf and Malaysia – taking out informal loans they struggle to pay back, said Bishal Tamang, an independent migration researcher and former migrant worker. In the worst cases, he said, this has resulted in workers taking their own lives.
“They will borrow money from lenders that charge huge interest rates and give their land deeds as a guarantee. It is normally land that has been in the family for generations,” he said. Tamang said he had previously paid RS100,000 (£645) to secure work in Saudi Arabia, but that workers can be charged more than 10 times as much for work in the UK. According to figures obtained through freedom of information requests, the most common allegations in the agriculture sector brought to the GLAA last year were in relation to recruitment fees. A total of 25 such allegations were made in 2021, more than three times the number made in 2018, the year before the scheme’s launch. “We need food on the shelves in supermarkets, and [migrant workers] have come to make that happen,” said Emily Kenway, a researcher and former adviser to the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner. “We’ve got to hold up our side of the bargain, which does not include workers being fleeced in order to get here.” Kenway said the GLAA has been more likely to pick up on these issues because it had working relationships with labour enforcement agencies in countries such as Romania, where most migrant workers came from before Brexit. But the GLAA’s resources have not kept pace with the increase in the number of countries from which workers are now being recruited – 58 in 2021. “We knew something like this was going to happen,” Kenway said. “Everyone who works on labour rights, modern slavery and trafficking has been saying from day one that there is a massive chance that we’re going to have exploitation taking place through the scheme because of its design and the lack of resourcing going into it.” The seasonal worker scheme, which issued just under 2,500 visas in 2019, is expecting to issue as many as 40,000 this year. Meanwhile, the Home Office’s funding for the GLAA last year was £7m – less than what it spent on publications, stationery and printing. Data released by the Home Office this week shows that Nepal has provided 395 seasonal workers to the UK in the first three months of this year – the fourth-highest country on the list.
Carolin Ott, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said the new findings were extremely concerning. “It is absolutely vital that this rapidly expanding scheme has necessary safeguards in place to prevent exploitation and ensure protection of seasonal workers’ rights,” she said. Several workers who went to work at Cobrey Farms in 2021 said the recruitment fees represented a significant proportion of their earnings. One Nepali migrant who harvested asparagus and blueberries said he had paid about £3,100 to a recruiter. He said the farm’s HR team learned in the summer of the “exorbitant fees” some workers said had been charged by My Careers HR Solutions. Ditya said she paid £4,420, including a £1,260 deposit that was returned to her when she went back to Nepal. When Concordia asked about recruitment fees during its investigation, she lied, saying she had only paid for her visa and flight, because she “didn’t want to get in trouble”. Chris Chinn, whose family runs Cobrey, said that the farm notifies and cooperates with the GLAA in the event of any alleged or observed breach of labour standards. He said Cobrey’s licence means it has been “assessed as meeting the rigorous standards set by the GLAA”. Concordia’s Simon Bowyer said that his company would not be refunding the workers, but would like to see My Careers HR Solutions do so. “I don’t know the exact nature of the relationship between My Careers and Poseidon,” he said, but we were not happy when we found that relationship – whatever it was – existed.” TBIJ and the Guardian have also seen training certificates issued to Cobrey workers that feature the logos of the British Council and Ofqual, both of which said that they have not accredited any of the people or companies named in the documents. Hurley put this down to a “certification mistake” that was being addressed. *Name has been changed Additional reporting by Pramod Acharya Share your experiences Have you worked on a UK farm as part of the seasonal worker visa scheme?

the-life-you-can-save-effective-giving/2022/may/25/peter-singer-how-the-concept-of-effective-giving-could-revolutionise-global-generosity,The Life You Can Save: Effective giving,Peter Singer: how the concept of effective giving could revolutionise global generosity,https://www.theguardian.com/the-life-you-can-save-effective-giving/2022/may/25/peter-singer-how-the-concept-of-effective-giving-could-revolutionise-global-generosity,"A toddler escapes from her mother in a busy street and is hit by a car. CCTV footage shows 18 people walking past the girl lying in the street injured, without stopping. Eventually another car hits her and it’s too late to save her. This shocking incident really happened in a city in China some years ago, and it’s one that Australian ethicist and philosopher Peter Singer finds effective in waking people up to the reality of world poverty. “You can say to people, so what do you think of these people who look the other way and didn’t do anything to help?” he says. “And obviously that’s really terrible, and there was a big outcry in China when the video was shown. But there’s a sense in which we’re also looking the other way, even if the children who are dying are further from us. Ethically, I’m not sure that it’s all that different.” Singer’s 2009 book The Life You Can Save – updated in 2019 and narrated in audio form by Stephen Fry and Kristen Bell – led readers along a philosophical path paved with statistics, analogies and moral challenges, to the inescapable conclusion that charity isn’t a choice; it’s our duty. And with statistics showing that 5 million children in the world never reach their fifth birthday for largely preventable reasons, the contrast at this point in history is shocking. “There are about 3.8 billion people living at a level of affluence never previously known except in the courts of kings and nobles,” Singer says. He calls for action from everyone, not just the super-rich, and for action much more direct than feel-good consumer choices such as ethical coffee and clothing. “It does give people this feeling that they’re trying to make the world a better place. But honestly, donating to the most effective charities is generally going to do a lot more good than just saying, ‘Well, I’m going to reuse my coffee cup rather than getting a disposable one each time’.”
Singer says the most common excuse he hears for why people aren’t donating generously is “how do I know that the money will reach the people who need it?” It’s one he has set out to counter, with an organisation that has grown from the ideas he originally put forward in the book. Prospective donors can now go to The Life You Can Save website and choose from a range of the most effective charities. Many of the charities featured make apparently small changes but with impressive overall results. The website does the research and crunches the numbers to convince donors their dollars are bringing about real change. About $70 can buy a 10-minute sight-saving cataract surgery in Africa. Less than 50c gives one person in a developing country lifetime access to iodised salt, the lack of which can jeopardise children’s mental health and often their survival. “Giving to a really effective organisation adds 20 or 30 or even 50% to the value of your gift,” Singer says. Another common reason people give for not donating – or avoiding what Singer says is their moral responsibility – is a sense of the futility of throwing money at a problem seen as insoluble. He says it’s a misconception that poverty is getting worse, and quotes UNICEF figures on one of the main tragic indicators of world poverty, child mortality. It currently stands at 5 million, a terrible statistic, but back in 2009 the number was 8.1 million. “The chances of any one child who’s born in the world dying before their fifth birthday has been reduced by [almost] half over the last dozen years,” Singer says. “That’s quite impressive, I think.” Singer argues that giving people good news is more likely to inspire generosity. “We are making progress, we can make progress, and eventually overcome this whole problem of mass extreme poverty continuing to exist in the world,” he says. This month Singer received the 2021 Berggruen Prize for Philosophy, making him the sixth winner of this relatively new award. Singer will live by his own rules and donate the US$1m ($1.4m) prize money, with half of it going to The Life You Can Save. “It was the intention of [philanthropist] Nicolas Berggruen to recognise philosophy as an important activity that has an impact on the world,” Singer says. “So I do feel honoured to receive that award and I see it as a recognition that what I’ve been trying to do for the last 50 years has had some success, that it has had an impact on the world. And I certainly know that philosophy does change people’s lives.” Download a free copy of Peter Singer’s book, and make a tax-deductible donation to one of The Life You Can Save’s recommended charities before the end of this financial year.",2022-05-25 01:07:37,147443
us-news/2021/nov/28/kevin-mccarthy-lauren-boebert-ilhan-omar,US news,Republican McCarthy risks party split by courting extremists amid Omar spat,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/28/kevin-mccarthy-lauren-boebert-ilhan-omar,"The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, said on Saturday he had “reached out” to Democrats over Islamophobic comments made by one of his party, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, about the Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar.
Boebert apologised for the remarks, in which she likened one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress to a suicide bomber, on Friday, saying she wanted to meet Omar in person. Omar responded by condemning the remarks and calling for action from party leaders. In a statement to CNN, McCarthy said: “I spoke with Leader [Steny] Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.” McCarthy did not condemn Boebert’s remarks. He also faced criticism from within his own ranks, after another pro-Trump extremist, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, tweeted that she had “a good call” with McCarthy and liked “what he has planned ahead”. Greene had criticised McCarthy, seeking to cast doubt on his ambitions to be speaker should as seems likely Republicans take back the House next year. A Republican who spoke anonymously to CNN and was described as a moderate said McCarthy was “taking the middle of the conference for granted. McCarthy could have a bigger math problem [in the election for speaker] with the moderates”.
The anonymous moderate said his wing of the party – more of a rump, perhaps, given Donald Trump’s dominance – was upset about McCarthy’s embrace of extremists. One such extremist, Paul Gosar of Arizona, was this month censured for tweeting a video which depicted him killing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – like Omar a leading progressive and woman of colour in Congress – and threatening Joe Biden. Gosar lost committee assignments. McCarthy said he would get them back under a Republican speakership and held out the same prospect to Greene, who was stripped of her committees in February for racist, antisemitic and generally incendiary behaviour. McCarthy has faced calls from the right to punish Republicans who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as the 10 who voted to impeach Trump over the deadly Capitol riot. Two who voted to impeach, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, will retire next year. Primary challengers await the rest including Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a stringent conservative nonetheless split from the Trumpists over the Capitol attack. On Saturday, Kinzinger criticised the minority leader’s call with Greene, writing: “Here is real strength, when Kevin McCarthy has to call a freshman begging for permission to stay in power. What has Kevin promised? The people deserve to know.” He also said it had “been a while” since most “normal members … last talked to Kevin”.
The anonymous moderate who spoke to CNN said the party was on a “collision course” with itself, as their side “isn’t going to take this much longer”. On Sunday, Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas who is seen by some as a possible presidential nominee from the more moderate side of the party, told CNN’s State of the Union McCarthy should have condemned Boebert. “Even in our own caucus, our own members, if they go the wrong direction, I mean, it has to be called out,” Hutchinson said. “It has to be dealt with particularly whenever it is breaching the civility, whenever it is crossing the line in terms of violence or increasing divides in our country.” Earlier this week, Jackie Speier, a senior Democrat from California, told the Guardian McCarthy had “a number of radical extremists in his caucus that are very effective communicators to the right fringe, and he can’t really rein them in because reining them in means they will attack him. “So they have become the face of the House Republicans. You might as well put a brass ring in Kevin McCarthy’s nose because they’re pulling him around.”",2021-11-28 14:23:48,134995
politics/2022/jun/26/women-with-children-in-uk-face-deportation-to-nigeria-and-ghana,Politics,Women with children in UK face deportation to Nigeria and Ghana,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/26/women-with-children-in-uk-face-deportation-to-nigeria-and-ghana,"Mothers and grandmothers, some of whom have lived in the UK for decades, are among those facing deportation to Nigeria and Ghana on a controversial Home Office charter flight on Wednesday. The women the Guardian has spoken to estimate that at least 10 of them are facing removal. Some suffer from severe mental health problems and are on anti-psychotic medication. It is unusual to see such a large number of women on a deportation flight to the west African countries. Human rights campaigners say there are a range of safety concerns regarding the removal of those due to be on board, including religious persecution, modern slavery, rights to family life, and persecution on the basis of sexual orientation. Charities have expressed concerns about delays with what are known as rule 35 reports, where these issues can be explored at detention centres. One 40-year-old mother of three British children has previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. She fled Nigeria after being persecuted for being a Christian in a majority Muslim area and travelled to the UK in 2009 on a false passport. She was pregnant at the time, was imprisoned for travelling on the false passport, and gave birth while in prison. When she became seriously mentally ill, her children were removed. The Home Office then evicted her because her children were no longer living with her. She ended up sleeping on the streets behind a church. Speaking to the Guardian from Colnbrook detention centre, near Heathrow, she said: “How can the Home Office separate me from my children? I’m not going to let it happen. If they force me to go, I will die. I will kill myself. I escaped Nigeria to save my life.” Adeniyi Raji, 48, is a gay man facing removal to Nigeria for a second time. He was interviewed by the Guardian in 2017 when he first faced deportation. “I’m in the UK because I need protection. If I’m returned to Nigeria, they will kill me,” he said. He shared screenshots of death threats he had received from people in Nigeria. One said: “So after all that we did to you before, you are still a practising homosexual. Wait until we see you down here, that will be the end of you.”
Government guidance published in February 2022 states that LGBTI people are persecuted in Nigeria, that gay men found to be involved in same sex acts are liable to be jailed for 14 years, while in the northern states, where Sharia law prevails, the punishment is death. Maria Brul of the charity Detention Action said: “This Ghana and Nigeria mass charter flight is due to forcibly expel many women with British children, some of who have lived here for over 25 years.” Emma Ginn, director of the charity Medical Justice, said: “We fear that our clients with severe mental health issues will be removed without having had a rule 35 report exploring any history of torture, trafficking, suicide risk and medical conditions. They are in a long queue to get an appointment for one of these reports from the healthcare unit. There continue to be serious defects in the detention safeguarding systems.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK only ever returns individuals to their country of origin when the Home Office and, where applicable, the courts deem it is safe to do so. “All asylum and human rights claims are carefully considered in accordance with our international obligations. Each individual assessment is made against the background of relevant caselaw and the latest country information. The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken immigration system and expedite the removal of those with no right to be here.”",2022-06-26 16:32:14,148806
cities/2018/jul/26/cover-up-jakarta-hides-foul-river-with-giant-net-before-asian-games,Cities,Cover-up: Jakarta hides foul river with giant net before Asian Games,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/26/cover-up-jakarta-hides-foul-river-with-giant-net-before-asian-games,"The Jakarta city government has come under fire for buying a giant nylon net to cover up a polluted and foul-smelling river weeks before the Indonesian capital hosts the 2018 Asian Games. The Sentiong River, which twists alongside the athletes’ village in Kemayoran in central Jakarta, is so polluted it is known by locals as kali item or the black river. The administration installed a 600 by 20 metre black mesh net earlier in July to minimise the putrid stench and unsightly view.
An official from the Jakarta water resources agency said the nets were intended to hide the aquatic eyesore. “Its function is to elevate the beauty [of the river] so that the black water cannot be directly seen by international athletes,” the official, Supriyono, told Kompas.
The cost of the river beautification plan is just over 580m rupiah (£30,000), Jakarta’s deputy governor, Sandiaga Uno, told reporters at city hall on Tuesday. The move has been criticised and ridiculed, with some saying the city government was more interested in covering up the river than in trying to clean it. Jakarta’s governor, Anies Baswedan, has argued that his administration inherited the chronic problem.
“If the past administrations took notice of this issue, we would not have inherited the black river,” he told Tempo. “But now it has grabbed widespread attention.” The governor said on a visit to the area that the river had to be covered up because it ran past the athletes’ dining hall. He also said the government was working to clean the waterway by employing aerators and “nano bubble” technology to help break down organic material. Water from a dam in Bogor in west Java is being pumped in to help flush the river out, and the city government said it planned to build more wastewater treatment plants.
Wastewater from houses and a nearby tofu factory have contributed to the condition of the Sentiong, one of many polluted rivers that run through Jakarta. The national development and planning board reported in February that 96% of river water in the Indonesian capital was severely polluted. The Asian Games begin on 18 August, with 11,000 athletes from 45 countries expected to attend the largest multi-sporting event after the Olympics. Events will be hosted in Jakarta and Palembang in south Sumatra.

film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola,Film,Ettore Scola obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola,"Ettore Scola, who has died aged 84, was the last in the direct line of great Italian film directors who descended from the neo-realists of the 1940s. “The inequalities and corruption of Italian society have always been a rich source of inspiration for my cinema, which I inherited from the neo-realists,” remarked Scola, who generally used satire and farce to pour scorn on the Italian social-democratic regimes from the 1960s onwards. Many of his “Italian style” films, the majority of which had ambivalent main characters played by Marcello Mastroianni, Vittorio Gassman and Nino Manfredi, take place against a background of historic events. Typical was Scola’s first international success, We All Loved Each Other So Much (C’eravamo Tanto Amati, 1975), in which three men from different backgrounds have been bound by their friendship for 30 years since they met as partisans in the second world war. The lives of Antonio (Manfredi), a good-natured, politically active proletarian; Gianni (Gassman), a bourgeois opportunist, and Nicola (Stefano Flores), a radical intellectual film buff, are paralleled by the events and the history of Italian cinema over the years. In this moving and amusing humanistic study of friendship, there are extracts from films by Michelangelo Antonioni, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica (to whom the film is dedicated).
Scola, whose parents were actors, was born in Trevico in the southern province of Campania. He studied law in Rome, but was more interested in drawing satirical cartoons. After dropping out of university, he joined the humorous magazine Marc’ Aurelio as a cartoonist, and there he got to know Fellini, who was on the editorial board. This connection helped Scola enter the film business as a writer of dozens of screenplays for broad Italian comedies from 1952 to 1964. Scola’s best scripts were for Dino Risi, whose comic style he assimilated as director. Let’s Talk About Women (Se Permettete Parliamo Di Donne, 1964), his first film as director, was a series of sketches (a form fashionable in Italy at the time) featuring the versatile Gassman in nine different roles. In Jealousy Italian Style, aka The Pizza Triangle (Dramma della Gelosia, 1970), Mastroianni, as a young communist bricklayer, leaves his wife for Monica Vitti. All is bliss until she falls for his waiter friend, played by Giancarlo Giannini. In this contribution to that Italian genre which uses dark, melodramatic plots to create comedy, Scola manages to achieve delightful moments of political and social satire.
After the triumph of the sensitive We All Loved Each Other So Much, whose theme, expressed by one of the characters was “We thought we’d change the world, instead the world has changed us”, Scola entered the realm of grotesque comedy with Down and Dirty aka Ugly, Dirty and Mean (Brutti, Sporchi e Cattivi, 1976). It focuses on a large family, headed by the ageing one-eyed Giacinto (Manfredi), living in squalor in one rat-infested room in a shanty town on the outskirts of Rome. Scola treats his poverty-stricken characters far less kindly than the directors of the Italian neo-realist movement, who saw the poor as innocent victims of a brutal system. No less critical of a system that breeds poverty, Scola shows its degrading effects in graphic, scatological detail, yet keeping an ironic distance. “Grotesque humour is a noble and tragic way of representing contemporary problems,” Scola claimed. In contrast, A Special Day (Una Giornata Particolare, 1977) told of two lonely residents of a seedy apartment building who are drawn together on the day in 1938 when the populace in the streets is cheering Hitler’s visit to Mussolini in Rome. Most of the appeal of this Oscar-nominated downbeat drama is the casting against type of Sophia Loren as a frumpish housewife, and Mastroianni as a depressed gay man. The film stresses how repression can be a common bond between two very different people. Passion of Love (Passione d’Amore, 1981), set in 1862, had an army captain (Bernard Giraudeau) transferred to a frontier post, where he meets a neurotic woman (Valeria D’Obici). To his horror, she conceives a hopeless passion for him, thus drawing him into a fatal web of pity and obligation. The film was the basis of the 1994 Stephen Sondheim musical Passion. This was followed by another successful period piece, That Night in Varennes (La Nuit de Varennes, 1982). During 1791, the French king and queen flee across the country in a coach that is finally captured by the people of Varennes. Observing them is a collection of people who include Casanova (Mastroianni), well past his prime, and the American revolutionary Tom Paine (Harvey Keitel). The group spends the journey engaged in philosophical discussion and commentary on life, love, politics and history – which is about to sweep several of them away in the revolution. The handsome film, glitteringly cast, is mounted in the style of an ambitious pageant and directed with finesse. One nice touch is that all that is seen of the ill-fated Louis and Marie Antoinette are their lower legs and feet. Le Bal (1984), which gained another Oscar nomination, followed events in France from 1936 to the present day as reflected inside a ballroom by the changing music and the characters who frequented the place over the years. Behind the decor and the caricature performances, one senses the pain of real events, underlined by the music. Films speak in many ways: Le Bal manages to say a lot without a single line of dialogue. Another Oscar-nominated film, The Family (La Famiglia, 1987), was a portrait of a bourgeois Italian family seen through the eyes of an old retired professor, over a period of 80 years, all the action of which takes place in the same apartment. Scola retired in 2003, stating that while Silvio Berlusconi was in power every film made in Italy was touched by some of his money. However, in 2013, he made How Strange to be Named Federico (Che Strano Chiamarsi Federico), an affectionate semi-documentary on his friend Fellini. He is survived by his wife Gigliola, and his daughters Silvia and Paola, both writers. • Ettore Scola, film director, born 10 May 1931; died 19 January 2016",2016-01-26 13:18:00,1751
environment/2022/jun/30/peatlands-in-england-at-risk-amid-apparent-flouting-of-regulations,Environment,"Burning ban failing to protect England’s peatlands, say conservation groups",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/30/peatlands-in-england-at-risk-amid-apparent-flouting-of-regulations,"The government is failing to protect peatlands in England, conservation groups have warned, with the country at risk of losing more of its most efficient carbon sinks. Figures obtained by Wildlife and Countryside Link suggest illegal burns of the areas, which are important for biodiversity and carbon sequestration, are likely to have taken place. Farmers and those who manage grouse moors burn the vegetation on peat in order to provide new shoots of heather or moor grass for sheep or grouse to eat. However, doing so releases carbon and animals that live there are roasted alive. Government figures for 2021, obtained through freedom of information requests, found that, in England, one large site of 50 hectares (123 acres) was licensed for burning, and there were no licences granted for sites under 10 hectares. Regulations brought in that year made it illegal to burn deep peat on a protected site without a licence. However, data from Wild Moors and Unearthed released earlier this year suggests that 51 burns took place on land protected by multiple conservation designations in the 2021-22 season. Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) research estimated that 70 burns took place on protected sites. This is despite the fact that the government did not grant licences for at least the majority of these burns, which conservation groups say suggests the regulations were being breached on a significant scale. Dr Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Peatlands ought to help the climate, water and wildlife. Instead, many of our peatlands have become heather monocultures that are releasing carbon, reducing water quality, and contributing to flooding. “Last year, the government insisted that its new regulations to limit burning heather on peatland would be effective, despite a series of loopholes in the legislation. This year, early evidence indicates that the burns continue at a significant scale, both on protected sites and outside them. It will be impossible to meet net zero while the land use sector remains a net emitter. Only by restoring peatland to retain and remove carbon from the atmosphere can we hope to curb our contribution to climate change. “The government should strengthen its partial burning ban to ensure that these globally important habitats are restored.” This week, the Climate Change Committee warned that peat restoration rates were well below the levels needed to achieve net zero by 2050, peatland under restoration management actually declined last year, and that damaged peat is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions from land use. Patrick Thompson, a senior policy officer at RSPB, said: “It’s clear that the new peatland burning regulations in England are not working and that burning is still taking place at a massive scale on peatland vegetation and inside protected sites. We are in a nature and climate emergency. Intensive and damaging land management practices such as burning continue to harm and further threaten these vital carbon and nature-rich ecosystems. This is why the RSPB is calling for a blanket ban of burning on all peat.”",2022-06-30 13:10:00,148029
world/2021/aug/31/does-the-fall-of-kabul-increase-the-terror-threat-to-the-west,World news,Does the fall of Kabul increase the terror threat to the west?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/31/does-the-fall-of-kabul-increase-the-terror-threat-to-the-west,"In three days in earlier this month Islamist militants killed more than 120 civilians in a series of attacks in the Sahel, a belt of increasingly anarchic and violent territory across Africa, where such groups have gone from strength to strength in recent years. Thousand of miles to the east, fighters from the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab stormed a military base in the centre of Somalia. None of these attacks received much attention – nor did the recent arrest of IS sympathisers in Australia, the attempted murder of a moderate politician in the Maldives or a court case against militants who attacked LGBT activists in Bangladesh. All should serve as a reminder that events in Kabul will have consequences wherever jihadist groups exist and so for the threat facing communities across the world, including in the west. The most obvious “game changer” is the huge boost offered by the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, with the effects of that victory amplified by the chaos and humiliation of the US withdrawal. The defeat of the USSR in Afghanistan has long been claimed by global jihadists. This is without historical justification – only a few hundred international extremists fought and made no significant contribution overall – but has become a foundational myth of their movement. Now a second superpower has been defeated, showing that “jihad and fighting is the only realistic way”, as a Yemen-based group said. But it is less clear that, as many analysts and pundits have said, events in Afghanistan have significantly increased the threat to the UK, US and other western states. Col Richard Kemp, a former British soldier and Afghan veteran, warned there was an imminent prospect of attacks in the UK inspired by the fall of Kabul while Stephanie Foggett, a resident fellow at the Soufan Center in New York, said the US exit could offer “significant opportunities” for Islamist extremist groups “to find a safe haven under Taliban protection and the operational space to recruit, rearm, and reunify in such a way that would allow for a refocus on the west in the future”. But not all experts are as convinced. Some believe the new rulers of Afghanistan will seek to restrain al-Qaida, as they did when previously in power from 1996 to 2001, despite their warm relations, and point out the Taliban have been fighting Islamic State for many years. There is also a question of timescale. “For regional powers this will certainly be a problem … You have to worry about Pakistan ... and if Pakistan turns bad then that has an echo in the UK because of our close connections,” said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. A series of plots in the UK over the last 20 years involved extremists further radicalised, trained or commissioned in Pakistan. So too did a handful of attempts to cause mass casualty attacks elsewhere – in western Europe and the US. But Pantucci said a flow of volunteers into Afghanistan or Pakistan and their return was only “a possible medium to long term potential risk” not “an immediate threat”. In the US, the major terrorist threat remains that from rightwing extremism, which has caused more casualties than Islamist-related violence since the 9/11 attacks, experts say. “We’ve not been immune and the list of lone actors inspired by global jihadist ideology trying to do what they can locally [in the US] with limited means is long…. But it’s such a small fraction of individuals,” said James Forest, professor at the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “The ideology simply doesn’t resonate here as it does with marginalised Muslim communities in France or Belgium of even parts of the UK.” Analysts have sought to explain this by contrasting the relative economic success of Muslim communities in the US with those in western Europe, or pointing to different models for integration of immigrants. There is also the question of quite which lessons different extremists draw from the Taliban victory. There have long been arguments between Islamist militant leaders who favour attacks on the “far enemy” – the west – and those who want to strike first against the “near enemy”, local governments and regimes. Factions that believe in temporary moderation to win local support oppose those that refuse any compromise. The range of reactions to the Taliban’s victory – al-Qaida has been enthusiastic whereas IS has attacked the Taliban as “apostates” – has revealed how deep these divisions are. “The Taliban are not champions of the global jihadi agenda. The global jihadists did not achieve victory. The Taliban has a much more local and provincial focus,” Forest said. This could be crucial. Some analysts suggest the Taliban’s pragmatic decisions to adapt to circumstances by carefully targeting its violence, emphasising governance, negotiating with the US and at least making some attempts to reassure international opinion will shape the impact of the movement’s victory. “There is now an understanding [among extremist groups] that a gradualist strategy is effective,” said Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based thinktank. “The Taliban have achieved a transformation of a Muslim land. What we are seeing is success locally, in part because the resolve of the west has weakened. This was in the works before Afghanistan, but Afghanistan gives them hope.”",2021-08-31 15:11:17,128879
uk-news/2017/nov/27/telegraph-owners-accused-of-washing-hands-of-historic-leeds-building,UK news,Telegraph owners accused of ‘washing hands’ of historic Leeds building,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/telegraph-owners-accused-of-washing-hands-of-historic-leeds-building,"The billionaire owners of the Telegraph have been accused of “washing their hands” of one of the UK’s most important and unusual industrial buildings after leaving it to rot for more than a decade and then putting it up for auction for a pound. Temple Works is a Grade I-listed former flax mill in Leeds which boasts a 0.8 hectare (2 acre) factory floor which was once the largest room in the world. It also saw the installation of the first ever hydraulic lift, used to transport sheep up to the roof for grazing. The sheep were part of a revolutionary rainwater collection system used to make steam to spin flax into yarn. The building, once described by the Yorkshire Post as looking “like a stately home for a pharaoh”, has been owned since 2004 by the secretive Barclay family, who bought the Telegraph media group in 2004. Built in 1836, it was modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu, on the banks of the Nile, reflecting the interest in Egyptology of John Marshall, the founder of the Leeds flax industry. According to Historic England, the building represents the zenith of the Marshall Mills flax business in Leeds and had acquired a legendary reputation within a few years of its construction. The Egyptian facade, featuring elaborate giant columns topped with lotus capitals and hieroglyphic-filled coving, was designed by the Egyptologist Joseph Bonomi, brother of the architect Ignatius Bonomi. Egypt had an important flax industry in the ancient world. The 10,948 sq metre (117,843 sq ft) mill featured among the Victorian Society’s 10 most endangered buildings six years ago, and is in a poor state of repair after a partial collapse in 2008. It is due to go up for auction on 7 December after Burberry cancelled £50m plans to use the site as a factory-cum-showroom. The complex was last used commercially in 2004, when it was a mail-order warehouse for the now defunct Kays catalogue. The Barclays inherited it in 2004 when they bought Kays, having already acquired another catalogue company, Littlewoods, in 2002. For several years, until February 2016, the building was used as a cultural hub called Temple.Works.Leeds as plans developed to turn the space into a northern rival to the Tate Modern. But with renovation costs estimated at upwards of £20m, the right buyer never emerged, and a local developer was outbid by Burberry on an option to develop the site. Burberry put the project on hold in 2016 amid Brexit uncertainty and eventually pulled out of the deal in July. The property will be auctioned next month with no reserve, meaning it will be sold to the highest bidder on the day regardless of the size of the bid.
Whoever buys the site will not only have to carry out major repairs but will have to figure out what to do with the enormous old factory floor. Lit by dozens of beautiful domed skylights, the masonry roof is only just held up by rotting hollow pipes which acted both as columns and to help to collect rainwater to make steam. Heritage campaigners fear that the auction process will encourage buyers who may underestimate the scale and cost of renovation. “We are disappointed that the owners have chosen to dispose of the building by auction. It feels like they are washing their hands of what they must see as a liability,” said Martin Hamilton, the director of Leeds Civic Trust. “There is now a real risk that a naive investor will purchase the building without the resources to spend on refurbishment – possibly upwards of £20m, leading to more years of neglect, planning and legal wrangles and quite possibly the final nail in the coffin for this building. “We would appeal to the owners to withdraw the building from the auction and to work with Leeds city council and other interested parties to identify a buyer with the necessary resources to turn the building round, and a use that would be a focus for the wider regeneration of this part of Leeds city centre.” The council has bought several acres of land around the site which it could offer the right buyer of Temple Works as a sweetener. By 2033, the HS2 railway station should have been built a short walk away. Martin Farrington, the director of city development, said: “Temple Works is a very significant part of the industrial heritage not just of Leeds but also the UK and the council will work collaboratively with an experienced developer who wants to bring the building back into sustainable use.” The Barclays did not respond for comment via the Telegraph press office. • This article was amended on 28 November 2017 to restore the word “only” to the sentence about the challenges facing whoever is the eventual buyer.",2017-11-27 07:00:17,43425
world/2021/nov/23/covid-deaths-in-europe-to-top-2-million-by-march-says-who,World news,"Covid deaths in Europe to top 2 million by March, says WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/23/covid-deaths-in-europe-to-top-2-million-by-march-says-who,"Total deaths across Europe from Covid-19 are likely to exceed 2 million by March next year, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, adding that the pandemic had become the number one cause of death in the region. Reported deaths have risen to nearly 4,200 a day, double the number being recorded in September, the agency said, while cumulative reported deaths in the region, which includes the UK, have already surpassed 1.5 million. Describing the situation as “very serious”, the WHO said it expected “high or extreme stress” on hospital beds in 25 of the region’s 53 countries, with intensive care units in 49 countries set to come under similar strain. On current trends, the region’s cumulative death toll would surpass 2.2 million by 1 March, it said. As Europe again becomes the centre of the pandemic, with tighter controls mainly on the unvaccinated and heated debate in several countries about making vaccination obligatory, Austria this week became the first west European country to re-enter lockdown since inoculation began earlier this year. The increase in cases was being driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant which is now dominant across the region, the WHO said, fuelled by a widespread relaxation of preventive measures, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, since the summer. With more and more people gathering indoors in the colder late-autumn weather, a large number still not vaccinated, and vaccine efficacy against severe forms of the disease waning, “many people are left vulnerable to the virus”. Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said it was essential that countries adopted a “vaccine plus” approach. “This means getting the standard doses of vaccine and taking a booster if offered,” he said, “but also incorporating preventive measures into our normal routines.” In combination with the vaccines, Kluge said, wearing a mask, washing your hands, ventilating indoor spaces, keeping physical distance, and sneezing into your elbow were “simple, effective ways of gaining control over the virus”. He added: “All of us have the opportunity and responsibility to help avert unnecessary tragedy and loss of life and limit further disruption to society and businesses over this winter season,” by avoiding “the last resort of lockdowns and school closures”. The WHO said more than 1bn vaccine doses had been administered in the WHO European region and 53.5% of people had completed their inoculation programme, but added that the figure “hides wide differences between countries”, with some populations less than 10% vaccinated and others more than 80%.
The vaccines were “are a vital tool to prevent severe disease and death” and had saved hundreds of thousands of lives, it said, calling for governments to do more to increase coverage, including by working with behavioural and cultural scientists to understand individual and community reluctance. But with evidence growing that the vaccines’ protection against infection and mild disease declined over time, it urged that booster doses “should be given to protect the most vulnerable, including the immunocompromised, as a priority”, as well as to the over-60s and heathcare workers as a precaution. Data showed only 48% of people across the region wear a mask when they leave home, it said, estimating that 95% mask usage could prevent more than 160,000 deaths that could otherwise occur before 1 March. “Today, the Covid-19 situation across Europe and central Asia is very serious,” Kluge said. “We face a challenging winter ahead, but … all of us – governments, health authorities, individuals – can take decisive action to stabilise the pandemic.”",2021-11-23 13:38:20,136051
world/2021/apr/22/eu-asks-states-to-back-legal-action-against-astrazeneca,World news,EU asks states to back legal action against AstraZeneca,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/eu-asks-states-to-back-legal-action-against-astrazeneca,"EU capitals have been asked by the European commission to back legal action against AstraZeneca by the end of the week over an alleged breach of its contractual obligations to supply member states with its Covid vaccine. At a meeting with commission officials on Wednesday, diplomats from some member states raised concerns about the wisdom of the move, warning against rushing into a decision that might further undermine confidence in the vaccine. The Anglo-Swedish company remains a key supplier from which the bloc is expecting a further 70m vaccine doses in the second quarter of this year. But, according to a diplomatic source, the commission’s vaccine steering board, containing representatives of all participating member states, was still asked to sign off on action by Friday in order to allow a claim to be filed. A spokesperson for the commission said no legal action had yet been taken. One diplomat said he believed there was sufficient support for a legal claim despite concerns being aired by France and Germany, among others. He said more than 20 member states had indicated they would back a legal claim. AstraZeneca delivered less than 30m of the expected 120m doses to EU member states in the first quarter of this year, and refused to redirect vaccines produced in the UK to make up for the losses. The commission sent a letter to the company on 19 March, described as a “a notice for dispute settlement”. According the contract signed between EU and the company, if a dispute arises one of the parties shall first notify the problem with a letter. After 20 days from the written notice, they “shall meet and attempt to resolve the dispute by good faith negotiations”. On Thursday Ireland’s health minister, Stephen Donnelly, said Dublin would back a legal claim by the commission. Speaking to the Irish parliament, he said: “With regard to AstraZeneca, a legal case has been initiated by the commission and earlier this week I have joined Ireland as one of the parties to that legal case, specifically around AstraZeneca’s complete failure to meet its delivery and contractual agreements for April, May and June.” This month the commissioner leading the EU executive’s vaccine taskforce, Thierry Breton, told the Guardian that the bloc would have had even greater success than the UK in vaccinating its citizens if it had not had supply problems. The EU is expecting more than 300m doses to be delivered by all its suppliers over the next three months. Speaking to the environment committee of the European parliament on Thursday morning, the health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, said she was confident that the bloc would hit its target of vaccinating 70% of the population by the end of August. She said: “This is ambitious but I believe that it is feasible. We have a much accelerated rollout for quarter two. There were big challenges in quarter one and we are seeing this moving.”",2021-04-22 16:49:32,122902
uk-news/2021/dec/30/after-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-spotlight-to-fall-on-prince-andrew-again,UK news,"After Ghislaine Maxwell trial, spotlight to fall on Prince Andrew again",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/after-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-spotlight-to-fall-on-prince-andrew-again,"Though he largely escaped scrutiny in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial, the Duke of York will not be able to dodge the spotlight in the new year when he is sued for alleged sexual assault. Prince Andrew will have been deeply relieved when his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, was not called as a witness in Maxwell’s case. But next week she is due in a New York court for the next stage of her civil action against him – a lawsuit Andrew’s lawyers will do everything to get thrown out. She claims the Queen’s son had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies. Following Maxwell’s conviction on Wednesday, Giuffre said: “I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be.” Her absence in the witness box at Maxwell’s trial was perplexing to many. Her name was introduced countless times, her photograph was shown in court and she has been one of the most prominent accusers of Epstein and Maxwell. A deposition, given by Maxwell in a 2016 civil suit brought by Giuffre, formed the basis of two perjury charges against the British socialite, who denied all charges. Giuffre was “available” if called upon to give evidence, the court heard. “Certainly, if she had been called, it would have seen Andrew centre-stage,” said Mark Stephens of the law firm Howard Kennedy. Prosecutors gave no reason for their decision. But they may have feared it would complicate the case, especially if inconsistencies could be shown in accounts Giuffre has previously given over the years. It could be, said Stephens, “that the reason the prosecution did not call Giuffre in the Ghislaine Maxwell case is that they risked an own goal if her credibility could be undermined, which would have given Maxwell a leg-up”. Andrew’s lawyers have sought to target Giuffre’s credibility as they attempt to get the case against him dismissed in the civil proceedings she has brought. His legal team has painted her as an unreliable witness, querying certain dates and figures she has provided, and accusing her of seeking another “payday”. She has previously explained any discrepancies as innocent mistakes, and the result of recalling events from many years ago that had left her traumatised. Andrew’s part in Maxwell’s courtroom drama was, therefore, reduced to mentions of him being a guest onboard Epstein’s “Lolita Express” private plane, with the pilots testifying to seeing nothing to suggest sexual activity on the part of those onboard during flights. “It’s fair to say, I think, there must be some relief for Andrew that Giuffre did not appear, because it does distance him, somewhat, from the case,” said Stephens. Nonetheless, he added, “it did not matter if Maxwell was found guilty, or innocent”, as the prince’s reputation was already tarnished, “indelibly so, as, frankly, the association with a convicted paedophile like Jeffrey Epstein is enough”. “A guilty verdict on Ghislaine Maxwell, you might say, is almost priced in regarding Prince Andrew and reputational damage. People have already made up their minds about him and the verdict would have no impact on how they view him.” Now Andrew must brace for the next round in the civil case against him, with the US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan scheduling a 4 January hearing when the royal’s lawyers are expected to argue for a dismissal of the case. If they are not successful, or if the case is not settled, it is expected to go for trial between September and December 2022. Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents 20 accusers of Epstein, said it was now a matter of having to wait and see if the civil sexual assault case in the US against the duke ever gets to trial. She told BBC Breakfast that “to prove a criminal case, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt” but “only a preponderance of evidence must be shown in order for there to be the possibility of the defendant being held liable” in a civil case.",2021-12-30 14:27:06,136679
teacher-network/2017/nov/30/we-help-them-flourish-and-bloom-using-nature-to-keep-students-in-education,Teacher Network,'We help them flourish and bloom': using nature to keep students in education,https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/nov/30/we-help-them-flourish-and-bloom-using-nature-to-keep-students-in-education,"In a corner of south London, a group of young people are taking it in turns to smell the leaves of a rose geranium plant in the gardens of Roots and Shoots, an environmental education centre and biodiverse wildlife park. The charity is tucked away, just off a street that you could easily walk past without noticing.
The exercise is part of a training programme for students from Lambeth and Southwark who have difficulty coping in the mainstream educational system. The trainees are all working towards a level one City and Guilds qualification, specialising in retail, floristry or horticulture. They will also study functional skills, employability and personal development. Among them is Shabaz Samuel, 21, who used to get in trouble with the police and was one of the UK’s 790,000 young people aged 16 to 24 not in education, employment or training (a Neet). He’s now in his final year of the programme, with plans to pursue a career in horticulture, but admits he didn’t originally want to get involved. “Doing gardening put me off,” he says. “I didn’t realise I would like [it] so much. It’s nice to see something you planted and think, ‘I grew that’.” Although he and the 30 other students, some of whom have learning disabilities, spend time in the classroom, they are more likely to be found outside on the 1.5-acre site, which includes beehives, a pond, a large greenhouse, raised beds and a barn. It’s a far cry from Samuel’s previous experience of college, where he says there were a lot of drugs: “I wouldn’t say this place has changed me, more that I had to change myself to be here. I’ve had to do a lot of growing up.” The programme boasts an impressive 85% retainment rate, and while the majority haven’t stuck with education in the past almost all (90%) will go on to further education or apprenticeships. Operations manager Matthew Brownlee explains: “We retain so many students despite their tricky backgrounds because they like it here – they get a lot out of it.” The trainees are referred to Roots and Shoots by a variety of organisations, including the Prince’s Trust. Local schools are also asked to choose students who are struggling and may benefit from a day a week spent on horticulture and environmental projects. Some of these pupils will go on to become full-time trainees.
Linda Phillips, who set up the charity in 1982 – originally as a three-year project for 18 young people – and is still the director, says everyone needs to become more connected to “the real world”, a phrase she uses to describe nature and the outdoors. She says: “The young people who come here often come from schools where the classroom situation wasn’t very good for them, and they have never really been properly outdoors. They relax here. They become more community minded.” She adds: “All the staff here are totally committed to helping kids who have often had terrible lives and help them have a more positive experience. Getting them out in the green environment ... improves their learning ability and we have been praised by Ofsted for that.” There is evidence to back this idea up. In 2015, Mind’s report Feel Better Outside, Feel Better Inside (pdf) found that activities such as gardening boosted self-esteem, improved physical health and benefited those at risk of developing mental health problems. The government’s food growing in schools taskforce (pdf) notes that growing food helps students to build life- and employment-related skills, while Growing Schools (pdf) reports that special educational needs students particularly benefit from outdoor education because it offers sensory experiences, chances for informal conversations, and the freedom of being in open spaces. This can be a novelty – an earlier study found that students with learning disabilities “still have particularly poor access (pdf) to learning outside the classroom”. In the centre’s library, Angela Barrado, the education manager, says educating students with complex needs mainly outdoors is not without its challenges and staff often work closely with families and social workers. “Many of [the students] come from deprived backgrounds, some have been in care, others have parents who have learning disabilities, or who live in homes without many rules,” she says.
While one of the main goals is to make the young people more employable, Barrado says teaching them personal hygiene or coping strategies to manage their feelings are also important priorities. “When you have so many barriers to learning, you have to break those before you can even get into the achievements. At the end of the day, it’s great to have certificates but being able to socialise, make friends and not feel bullied is [often] more important. Our strength is helping them flourish and bloom.” One example of this is catering assistant Carlene Johnson. She began the programme straight from secondary school in 2007 and has been employed by the centre since 2010. Johnson, who has learning disabilities, says she initially found the training difficult: “I was excited to experience something different but I found it challenging when we went out to places on visits with the teacher, and also talking to people. I was so shy and nervous.” When both the meeting rooms and the larger space are busy, she can be responsible for catering for up to 100 people at a time. But now, she says, the best bit of the job is the friendly people she meets every day. “It can get very busy,” she says. “But I’m confident now – that’s because of Roots and Shoots.” Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inbox Looking for a teaching job?

commentisfree/2020/feb/25/bernie-sanders-democrats-brokered-convention,Opinion,A 'brokered convention' designed to block Bernie Sanders would be a poison pill | Nathan Robinson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/bernie-sanders-democrats-brokered-convention,"Something deeply troubling happened during last week’s Democratic presidential debate, though it was overshadowed by Michael Bloomberg’s spectacular implosion. Towards the end, the candidates were asked whether they believed that the person who receives the most votes should be given the Democratic nomination. The only candidate who said “yes” was Bernie Sanders. All of the others said they wanted the “process” to “play out”. It’s not surprising that the non-Sanders candidates don’t want “winning the primaries” to determine who the nominee is, because by that measure, it’s very unlikely to be any of them. Sanders has lately taken a commanding lead in the polls and is now the favorite to win in the vast majority of states. He received more votes than any other candidate in both Iowa and New Hampshire, which political scientists treat as a strong sign that a candidate will ultimately win. There are growing concerns in the party that Sanders’ lead may be becoming “insurmountable”. But the other Democrats have not given up. They still hold out hope that they can win through what is known as a “brokered convention”. If Sanders has only a plurality of delegates at the Democratic national convention in July, rather than an outright majority, he might not win the nomination on the first ballot. Under convention rules, this would allow “superdelegates” to vote on the second ballot, and open up the possibility that other candidates can “horse trade” their delegates in order to receive the nomination, even if Sanders won all or most of the primaries and a strong plurality of pledged delegates.
It may seem ludicrous to deny Sanders the nomination if he wins the most delegates and sweeps the primaries. What’s the point in having primaries if party insiders at the convention just override the result and choose a nominee they prefer? But Democrats who fear Sanders’ takeover of the party, or who fear that a “radical” cannot beat Donald Trump, will argue that democracy needs to take a backseat to the urgency of choosing a “unity” candidate. Michael Bloomberg is reported to be plotting a brokered convention strategy, whereby other candidates would give him the delegates necessary to beat Sanders in exchange for various commitments and handouts. And Democrats are already trying to convince people that brokered conventions are fine, with the former Democratic Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell writing that we “shouldn’t fear” a brokered convention, because it would be “exciting”. The candidates’ answers on the debate stage indicated that each of them is open to using the “process” to subvert the result of the elections, if that’s what it takes to win. But these strategies are an outright rejection of democracy, and should be treated as such. “The candidate with the most votes ought to win” is a sound electoral principle, albeit one that is absent in many areas of American politics, from the Iowa caucuses to the electoral college. If “superdelegates” swung the nomination to a candidate with fewer votes, it would be confirmation that the country is ruled by elites rather than governed by the people.
Critics will point out that in 2016, the Sanders camp briefly floated the possibility of lobbying superdelegates for the nomination. Indeed, and it would have been wrong then, too, if it had happened, which it didn’t. Hillary Clinton won through getting millions more votes, and nobody should have taken it away from her. Not that they ever would have: the superdelegates were overwhelmingly for Clinton, even in states that Bernie won, and the process ended up being far more unfair to Sanders. It’s understandable that campaigns are getting desperate to win by any means necessary. Elizabeth Warren, after criticizing the other candidates for having Super Pac support, has reversed her position and accepted help from a Super Pac in an attempt to win Nevada. Last week’s debate was the nastiest of the entire cycle, with candidates doing everything they could to tear one another down. But while we can see why they’d want to exploit existing processes however they can, there’s no reason we should let them. Besides, if a candidate did win through a brokered convention, it would be a disaster for the Democrats in November. Millions of Sanders supporters would be enraged at having the nomination snatched from them and might defect to a third party. Even those who did support a nominee they considered illegitimate would do so only grudgingly. The Democrats might be able to stop Sanders, but in doing so they would destroy their party’s own electoral prospects. It would be a completely reckless and irrational maneuver, and every sensible Democrat should oppose it. If Democrats decide to take this “poison pill” and have party elites choose their own nominee, voters will need to be prepared to fight back. As Sam Lewis and Beth Huang write in Jacobin, anyone who votes to deprive the rightful nominee of the nomination “should be taking that vote with the absolute certainty that the organized working class in this country will use civil disobedience, mass protest, and primary election challenges to exact retribution and remove them from office”. But hopefully even self-interested Democrats are smart enough to realize that there’s no real alternative to respecting the results of the election, at least not one that would offer a chance of beating Donald Trump.",2020-02-25 11:16:48,95372
science/2021/sep/26/gene-editing-would-allow-us-to-create-hardier-farm-breeds,Science,Gene editing ‘would allow us to create hardier farm breeds’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/26/gene-editing-would-allow-us-to-create-hardier-farm-breeds,"Leading UK researchers, vets and farmers have urged ministers to free livestock science of unnecessary legal curbs as the country prepares, post-Brexit, to ease gene-editing rules. Such a move would allow the creation of new breeds of animals resistant to disease, heat and drought, they argue. The government is expected to propose easing gene-editing restrictions in the near future to enable the creation of new generations of crops. However, the group – which has written to the environment secretary, George Eustice – worries there is less interest in using the technology to create new breeds of pigs, cows and poultry. “It is every bit as important that we use the enormous power of gene editing to create breeds of animals that are resistant to disease, droughts and heatwaves as it is to fashion new crop varieties,” said Professor Bruce Whitelaw of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute. “This is particularly important as global warming intensifies and we strive to ensure we are protected against future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.” The value of gene editing in this latter field is shown by work carried out at Roslin and Imperial College London, where scientists have identified a gene that may confer resistance to influenza. “We can now think about using gene editing to create breeds resistant to avian and swine flu, and so curb outbreaks on farms, while also reducing the risk of triggering future pandemics in humans,” added Whitelaw, one of the letter’s signatories. Other recent developments in the gene editing of livestock include the creation of pigs that can fight off a disease known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which is devastating pig herds globally. “Using gene editing this way has enormous power to save billions of pounds and to stop animal suffering,” said Whitelaw. Earlier, the creation of new strains of plants or animals in the laboratory involved the transfer of entire genes or groups of genes from one species to another and was known as genetic modification. The EU strictly regulates GM technology. More recent techniques of gene editing involve making slight changes to existing genes in a plant or animal and are considered to be as safe as traditional plant breeding techniques. The European court of justice nevertheless controversially ruled in 2018 that gene editing was essentially the same as genetic modification and should be subject to tight rules. “Gene-editing research in the UK has been hampered by the unnecessary and unscientific regulatory barriers we have inherited from the EU,” said Professor Helen Sang, also of the Roslin Institute and a signatory of the letter. “This leaves us lagging behind the approach taken in other parts of the world, such as Japan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Canada.” Britain is expected to throw off these legislative shackles with an announcement soon from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, a report by the Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform earlier this year advised the government to press ahead with regulatory reform of gene editing of plants and crops but was more cautious about its use on livestock.
Such an emphasis would represent a lost opportunity, said Professor Lord Trees, an expert in vaccine parasitology and another signatory to the letter. “The UK’s strength in genome sequencing, together with our preservation of rare breeds and genetic diversity offers great potential. “This could have a very significant impact in reducing antimicrobial and antiparasitic drug usage and help overcome the challenges of resistance to chemical treatment, as well as the problem of environmental contamination with drug residues.” Many green groups remain opposed to the creation of new, gene-edited breeds of pigs, cows and poultry, arguing that they will only worsen the intensification of factory farming. “Some people just don’t like the idea of genetically altering animals,” said Whitelaw. “But we have been doing that for thousands of years, and have turned wolves into chihuahuas and no one seems to mind.”",2021-09-26 05:30:03,131731

environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities,Environment,Kenya's new front in poaching battle: 'the future is in the hands of our communities',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities,"“It’s hard work. I cut their tusks off with an axe,” said Abdi Ali, a northern Kenyan pastoralist who became a full-time poacher at 14. With three other men it took him about 10 minutes to kill each of the 27 elephants he poached, cutting off the trunk, splitting the skull and removing the ivory that would later fetch 500 Kenyan shillings (£3) a kilo. But while he became rich compared with the cattle herders, who mostly live on less than $1 (68p) a day, he did not find happiness. “Much as I had money, it was money I couldn’t enjoy in peace, because I was on the run.” Men like Ali are the bottom rung of a network of organised crime that is devastating Africa’s wildlife. It stretches from the remote wilds of Kenya to the port of Mombasa and out to China and south-east Asia, where an affluent middle class buy ground-up rhino horn as a status symbol and ivory is carved and sold as ornaments and trinkets. This week, the UN Environment Programme launched a global campaign to end the multibillion dollar trade, backed by celebrities including footballer Yaya Touré and model Gisele Bündchen.
Kenya, hit by a poaching surge in 2012 and 2013 that resulted in the loss of more elephants and rhino than at any time in the past two decades, is taking the problem seriously. Last month it set ablaze more than 100 tonnes of seized ivory, in what conservationists said was an “SOS to the world”. It followed a new wildlife law that can inflict a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for poachers. The men who kill in the field are relatively easy for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and private rangers to catch, compared with the middlemen and kingpins orchestrating the trade. Lochuch Lotak is another who swapped the poverty of grazing his livestock in northern Kenya for killing elephants with a gun for their valuable ivory. Like Ali, he says it was an uneasy existence. “By the time it became common knowledge I was a poacher, I became really scared and suspicious of everyone, I thought everyone was telling on me. It got to the point where I was ready to die or kill [people].” Yet Ali and Lotak’s route out of poaching was not via a jail cell, but an extraordinary 27-year-old woman who chastised them for their crimes and, later, recruited them as rangers. “She got me out of a mud pool and into a pool of light,” Lotak said of Josephine Ekiru, the chair of the Nakuprat-Gotu conservancy, a community-run conservation area in northern Kenya where the two former poachers now work. In a pastoral community where women are traditionally expected to defer to their husbands and keep their opinions private, a 16-year-old Ekiru insisted on attending community meetings that were normally the preserve of men, and began trying to reform the men she knew were poaching. But confronting the poachers put her own life on the line.
“First they wrote a letter to me threatening me. The second time, they called in [five men] to me and threatened me. That time they were pointing guns at me. I said I was ready to die but can I tell you some reasons [why she was trying to persuade them],” she recalled. For 20 minutes she told them they were being used, that they were creating conflict between ethnic groups and were destroying the “treasure” that was their local wildlife. “One of them said: ‘Don’t kill her’, he dropped his gun. He said, ‘Nobody has ever told us about this.’” Ekiru’s conservancy is one of 33 in a network known as the Northern Rangelands Trust, which prides itself on being community-run and working with local people as a way to curb poaching. The conservancy model was born out of Lewa, a privately owned and well-armed cattle ranch that was transformed into a safe haven for black rhino. More than two decades after it was established, Lewa teems with endangered Grévy’s zebra, elephants, African buffalo, cheetah, reticulated giraffes, baboons, warthogs, and a riot of birds including the Kori bustard, one of the world’s heaviest flying birds. With 61 black rhino, it also has about 10% of all the country’s remaining and critically endangered black rhino. Those animals are protected by 150 rangers covering 62,000 acres, 37 of them armed, five dogs for tracking, three aircraft, a helicopter, and a hi-tech operations centre that plots rangers’ and elephants’ movements across a Google Earth map. And it has the neighbouring communities, which John Pameri, head of security, calls his first line of defence. “If you get those people on your side, you are really winning on poaching,” he said.
Lewa has not lost a rhino in the past three years but 17 were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2013, before its security operation was beefed up. “I’ll admit we were caught with our pants down in terms of our capacity to deal with it and our understanding of the dynamic,” said Mike Watson, its chief executive. With a single rhino’s two horns worth $40,000-$60,000 on the black market, Lewa insiders giving information could earn $3,000 for tipping off poachers, Pameri said. An internal corruption investigation led to nine staff being dismissed or arrested. “Any organisation that says it is not internally compromised is living in cloud cuckoo land,” said Watson. Dr Richard Leakey, the renowned conservationist whom president Uhuru Kenyatta appointed as chair of the struggling KWS last year, shares the sentiment. “I don’t think anyone today would deny Kenya is a very corrupt country. The corruption isn’t just in wildlife management, but at the ports, at law enforcement agencies, it’s with the customs, parts of the judiciary, it’s certainly present at many levels in the police force, it’s certainly very real and still is to a certain extent in the KWS. Government administration is in places, particularly in the countryside, compromised,” he said.
Leakey, 71, who has taken on the full-time job unpaid, discovered a national wildlife service that had been “run into the ground financially”, filled with middle managers instead of rangers on the ground, vehicles that didn’t work, houses that were falling down and plummeting morale. He installed a former banker as KWS’s director to get its finances under control, slim down the bloated bureaucracy and weed out corrupt officials. But Leakey is under no illusions as to the scale of the challenge. More ivory is shipped out of the port at Mombasa on Kenya’s coast than anywhere in Africa and, despite a recent staff cleanup by Kenyatta, the corruption is still there. Cameras get switched off, or pointed briefly at the sun, or truck scanners are deactivated. “There are too many people employed there, something like 6,000 people. There’s a built-in probability that a good number of people are there for the wrong reason.” Critics say the KWS is only catching the bottom of the food chain, a charge Leakey does not duck. “Inevitably, we will get the majority of people caught red-handed with firearms or trophies. In some cases they lead you to middlemen. The link between middlemen and kingpins is a much harder route to follow, because kingpins are generally associated with syndicate crime.” Despite the tougher penalties under the 2013 Wildlife Act, just 6% of wildlife criminals convicted during 2014-15 received a prison sentence, according to the respected Kenyan non-governmental organisation, WildlifeDirect. “To date no high-level trafficker has been convicted and sentenced by Kenyan courts,” it said in a report looking at more than 500 court cases in 2014 and 2015.
Ofri Drori, a private investigator who runs the Eagle Network, which has put 1,300 wildlife traffickers behind bars in nine countries, said the big traffickers were not being targeted, and the reason is corruption. “The poacher is very easily replaceable,” he said of men like Ali and Lotak, who poached to escape grinding poverty. “The ability to pull the trigger and hunt something as big as an elephant doesn’t require much talent. It’s organised crime, so when you are chasing poachers in the field, you are really not understanding how organised this crime is.” In the field, the battle to save Kenya’s last 32,000-odd elephants and about 1,000 black and white rhino continues. To Ekiru, the answer lies in having local people run the show. “The only future we have for this wildlife is in the hands of the communities living with this wildlife.” For Leakey, sitting in his office in Nairobi, the problem will not go away until the demand in China does – and he thinks there are signs the Chinese government is committed to ending that. “If we can persuade the market that it’s a shame to do this, as we did before … there just won’t be the need for these elephants to be killed.” The Guardian’s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.",2016-05-30 08:40:04,8233
sport/2018/mar/30/tiger-woods-masters-walking-miracle,Sport,Tiger Woods targets Masters title and claims to be a ‘walking miracle’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/30/tiger-woods-masters-walking-miracle,"Tiger Woods described himself “a walking miracle” as he prepared to return to major championship action at the Masters. Next week will mark the former world No 1’s first appearance at Augusta National since 2015. Wood has suffered persistent back troubles, which culminated recently in fusion surgery. “I got a second chance on life, I am a walking miracle,” he said. Woods has the same aspiration as always at what he called “the best-run tournament in the world”. The 14-times major champion added: “I’m just there to win.” Ian Poulter’s hopes of joining Woods in the Masters field received a huge boost as the Englishman hit a second-round 64 at the Houston Open. Poulter’s opening score of 73 had left him 124th in the field. “Are you going to pack your suitcase, throw it in your car and go home or go out there and play?” Poulter said. “I rolled a few putts in and moved up the leaderboard.
“I actually played all right yesterday. That’s why I was so angry, because I wasn’t that bad and wanted to give myself a chance.” Shane Lowry’s consecutive 68s leave him eight under and a shot ahead of Poulter. The Irishman is also chasing the Houston win that would earn him the last available Masters berth. “I have a flight booked home to Ireland next Friday and if I have to change that, it’s a good problem,” Lowry said. “I’m a long way from thinking about that just now. Hopefully I can get myself right there on Sunday afternoon, then it’s something to think about. “ I have played the last three Masters so to not be there would be disappointing but I badly need a good week on this tour. I’ve got off to a good start here and I’m happy.”",2018-03-30 20:18:37,50373
business/2020/nov/29/philip-green-arcadia-administration-hours-topshop,Business,Philip Green urged to plug pension gap before Arcadia administration,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/29/philip-green-arcadia-administration-hours-topshop,"The Arcadia boss, Sir Philip Green, has come under pressure from MPs and unions to use his private fortune to “make good” the huge shortfall in his retail empire’s pension scheme ahead of the company’s expected collapse into administration. The owner of household names including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton is expected to enter administration in coming hours after the weekend failed to bring a last-minute rescue deal for Green’s retail businesses. The appointment of administrators would make Arcadia the biggest corporate failure of the pandemic and in effect end the career of one of the most colourful and controversial British businessmen of the last three decades.
Amid concerns about the impact of possible job cuts from the 13,000 workforce, there were fears that thousands of staff would suffer cuts in their retirement income should the pension scheme fall into the lifeboat Pension Protection Scheme. Stephen Timms, the chair of parliament’s work and pensions select committee, called on Green and his family to plug an estimated £350m funding shortfall. He said he would write to the Pensions Regulator on Monday to “underline the importance of securing the interests of pension scheme members”, adding: “Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund.” The former Labour MP Frank Field, who clashed with Green when his BHS department store chain went bust leaving a huge hole in its pension fund, said Green should honour previous promises that he would look after his “family” of workers. The Pension Protection Fund, which is supported by other occupational schemes, is expected to accept the Arcadia pension schemes, but will apply a 10% cut to staff pension payouts. The company’s collapse was also expected to jeopardise a takeover by JD Sports of the department store chain Debenhams, which rents out space to dozens of Arcadia-owned outlets. Questions about the immediate future of Green’s fashion empire surfaced on Friday after it became known that talks he had been holding with potential lenders for a £30m loan had failed. The group had been seeking extra funding to help it plug the gap from lost sales during coronavirus restrictions and the closure of nonessential shops including clothing stores. It is understood that Green and Arcadia would favour a so-called light-touch trading administration, to protect the business from creditors while the administrators seek a buyer for all or parts of the company. This process, which is currently being used byDebenhams, would allow Arcadia’s management to keep control of the day-to-day running of the business during the sale. Crucially, it would also allow Arcadia’s shops in England to reopen on 2 December when the lockdown lifts, to try to capture some essential pre-Christmas trade. Arcadia’s fall into administration would have wider repercussions for the retail sector in the UK. JD Sports has been holding exclusive talks over a purchase of Debenhams and had been expected to make a decision by the end of last week about whether to proceed. But the company is thought to be reconsidering the deal, given the anticipated collapse of Arcadia, which is one of the biggest concession holders at Debenhams. JD Sports declined to comment. However, the potential departure of brands such as Dorothy Perkins and Burton from Debenhams branches would leave a potential buyer with a lot of empty space. Mike Ashley, the chief executive of Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, has been named as potential rescuer of both Arcadia and Debenhams. However, it is understood that Ashley, a billionaire who bought the House of Fraser department store chain out of administration in 2018, has not submitted any offer to Arcadia’s board. Arcadia Group was in difficulty long before the pandemic and narrowly avoided administration last year, when Green managed to get creditors to back a rescue plan that involved closing 50 stores and cutting 1,000 jobs. Green was widely criticised following the collapse of BHS in 2016, a year after he sold it to a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, when it had a £571m pensions deficit. Green ended up paying £353m to support the BHS scheme after pressure from the regulator. Arcadia’s pension scheme is in a better positionthan that of BHS, although Green’s wife, Tina, who is the ultimate owner of Arcadia, has previously pledged to pay an extra £100m into the Arcadia scheme over three years. She has already paid £50m of the promised additional cash, and the rest is guaranteed to be paid next year.
Arcadia’s latest troubles highlight the plight of the British high street, which has accelerated during the pandemic, according to the Unite union, which represents about 50 staff working at the group’s head office. The Unite regional officer Debbie McSweeney said: “We call on the government to redouble its efforts to formulate a radical post-Covid-19 blueprint to revive the country’s ailing town centres and high streets. Such a strategy is desperately needed as high streets underpin the social fabric of our communities.” She added: “Unite is strongly committed to ensuring that our members receive their full notice and redundancy pay, should the next step be administration.”",2020-11-29 19:04:51,111824
world/2021/dec/26/fauci-trump-covid-omicron-vaccines,World news,Fauci says Omicron surge will continue and Americans must not be complacent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/fauci-trump-covid-omicron-vaccines,"Cases of Covid-19 will continue to surge worldwide due to the Omicron variant, the US chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, said on Sunday, warning Americans not to get complacent amid reports that the variant is less harmful than others.
“If you have many, many, many more people with a less level of severity,” Fauci told ABC’s This Week, “that might kind of neutralise the positive effect of having less severity. “We’re particularly worried about those who are in that unvaccinated class ... those are the most vulnerable ones when you have a virus that is extraordinarily effective in getting to people.” Fauci also welcomed Donald Trump’s endorsement of Covid-19 vaccines and boosters, saying: “We’ll take anything we can get about getting people vaccinated.” But Trump prompted rebarbative anger among supporters and amid a huge case surge, with knock-on effects feared for the economy and schools, Fauci also admitted the US had “to do better” on providing access to testing. Speaking to Axios, Fauci said it was “conceivable that sooner or later everybody will have been infected and/or vaccinated or boosted”. “When you get to that point,” he said, “unless you have a very bizarre variant come in that evades all protection – which would be unusual – then I think you could get to that point where you have this at a steady level.” But he also suggested fourth shots might yet be needed. On ABC, he was asked why “we still don’t have affordable tests widely available to anybody who needs it”. “If you look at the beginning of the [Biden] administration,” Fauci said, “… there were essentially no rapid point-of-care home tests available. Now, there are over nine of them and more coming. Production has been rapidly upscaled. “… But the situation where you have such a high demand, a conflation of events, Omicron stirring people to get appropriately concerned and wanting to get tested as well as [a] run on tests during the holiday season – we’ve obviously got to do better. “I think things will improve greatly as we get into January, but that doesn’t help us today and tomorrow. So you’re right, [access to testing] is of concern.” Another leading public health expert said he did not think the case for possible fourth vaccine shots needed to be made right now. “If we need it I think our health system is prepared,” Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told Fox News Sunday. “But let’s actually talk about whether we need it or not. And at this moment, based on the data I’ve seen, I’m pretty skeptical that we’re gonna need a fourth shot. “Part of the question is that we have to ask ourselves what are we trying to do? Are we trying to block every single infection? Maybe that’s our goal. If that’s our goal then yes, maybe we need a fourth shot. Or are we just trying to prevent serious illness and death? Which, of course, I think should be our primary goal. “So I’m pretty unconvinced at this moment that we need a fourth shot … let’s get a lot more data before we even really start seriously thinking about it.” Jha also said school closures – feared by many parents – should not be increasing. “We know how to keep schools open,” he said, “we know how to keep them safe. This really shouldn’t even be on the table. I’m disappointed to see this happening. “We know that for kids being in school is the right thing for them, for their mental health, for their education. And we have all sorts of tools to keep schools open so I don’t really understand why school districts are [closing schools]. “… There could be times when you have such severe short staffing shortages that it may be hard to keep schools going. That really should be the only context I think at this point.” More than 816,000 have died from Covid in the US but resistance to vaccinations and other public health measures remains strongest in states and counties that voted for Trump. On ABC, Fauci was asked if he thought the former president’s supporters would listen to his support for vaccines. “Well, I certainly hope so,” he said. “We’ll take anything we can get about getting people vaccinated.” But Fauci also said he was “dismayed” when Trump followers in Dallas booed him for supporting vaccines. “I was stunned by that,” he said. “I mean, given the fact of how popular he is with that group, that they would boo him … tells me how recalcitrant they are about being told what they should do. “I think that his continuing to say that people should get vaccinated and articulating that to them, in my mind is a good thing. I hope he keeps it up.” Trump also backed vaccines in an interview with the conservative commentator Candace Owens, saying: “The vaccines work … the ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine … and if you take the vaccine, you’re protected.”
On Instagram, Owens said Trump was backing vaccines because he was “old” and “came from a time before TV, before internet, before being able to conduct … independent research”. Last week, after Biden recognised his predecessor’s efforts to develop vaccines, Trump said he was “appreciative”. Biden also commended Trump for receiving a booster, saying it “may be one of the few things he and I agree on”. On Sunday, Vice-President Kamala Harris was asked on CBS’s Face the Nation if the unvaccinated were to blame for the Omicron surge. “I don’t think this is a moment to talk about fault,” Harris said. But she added: “It is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalisation if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster. And so I urge people to do that.”",2021-12-26 17:36:22,137225
world/2021/oct/31/simon-zukas-obituary,World news,Simon Zukas obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/simon-zukas-obituary,"My friend Simon Zukas, who has died aged 96, first became prominent in the political life of Northern Rhodesia (later Zambia) in 1951, as one of the founders and leaders of a radical, and predominantly African, committee that opposed the establishment of the settler-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In April 1952 the colonial government, holding that he was “a danger to peace and good order”, sought to deport him to the UK, a country with which he had no connection. He was held in prison in Livingstone for eight months and was then removed to London in December 1952. Appeals against his deportation, which went as far as the privy council, failed. Born in Ukmergė, Lithuania, the son of Chaim and Libe Zukas, Simon had arrived in Northern Rhodesia with his family in July 1938, a few days before his 13th birthday. His father had left Lithuania in 1936 with no foreknowledge of the catastrophe that was soon to strike the Jewish population. Simon arrived in Ndola speaking only Yiddish and Lithuanian, but he was soon top of the class. Within five years he had won a scholarship to study civil engineering at the University of Cape Town. He volunteered to do wartime military service and spent three years with African troops in East Africa. Taking up his university place in 1947, he became a radical socialist. He was close to, though not then a member of, the Communist party of South Africa. In exile in London from 1953, he became a co-founder of the Movement for Colonial Freedom and was from 1960 a member of the London committee of the United National Independence party (UNIP). He met and in 1954 married Cynthia Robinson, a South African artist, and set up a successful civil engineering consultancy. He was given a hero’s welcome on his return to Zambia before independence in 1964. For more than 20 years he devoted himself to civil engineering and commercial farming, but in 1990, disillusioned with the one-party state and Zambia’s economic decline, he became a founder of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD). Following the defeat of President Kenneth Kaunda and UNIP in 1991, he joined the new government and served as minister of agriculture and then public works. He resigned in 1996 over a matter of principle relating to the political rights of immigrants and their children, but returned to politics in 2001 as one of a group, the Oasis Forum, that successfully opposed Frederick Chiluba’s attempt to secure an unconstitutional third presidential term. He then became chair of a new opposition party, the Forum for Democracy and Development (FDD), stepping down in 2005. He never, however, retired from political life. Ten days before his death, he led a deputation of elders to call upon the newly elected president, Hakainde Hichilema. Always committed to democracy, he welcomed Zambia’s third change of government through the ballot box. His state funeral was marked by a day of national mourning. He is survived by Cynthia, their sons, David and Alan, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",2021-10-31 17:33:59,132625
stage/2019/dec/30/i-am-what-i-am-jerry-herman-anthem-la-cage-aux-folles,Stage,I Am What I Am: the Jerry Herman anthem that anyone can own,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/30/i-am-what-i-am-jerry-herman-anthem-la-cage-aux-folles,"I was leaving a wedding when I heard that Broadway legend Jerry Herman had died, which feels about right. I Am What I Am, his signature anthem from La Cage aux Folles, is a song to be scaled whenever drink has been taken and identity totters: by a spangled diva in the spotlight, a club kid staking a claim, a bridesmaid clinging desperately to dignity. Anxious, defiant, you stare into the dazzle, hitch up your tits and sing. La Cage is a Feydeau farce with show tunes, pitting a cabaret queen against the moral majority, with a book by Harvey Fierstein (who later lent his gravel-pit register to the song on Broadway). When drag queen Albin is disinvited from his own son’s wedding, he refuses to shuffle out of the picture. One draft speech included the line, “I am what I am and there’s nothing I can do.” Herman’s synapses rippled. “Hold everything,” he exclaimed. “I want to take those five words, if you will give them to me … I can write you a first-act closer that will be a killer because I feel that emotion in me.” The next morning, he gathered everyone in his 61st Street studio and sang through the mounting choruses. “The reaction was cataclysmic.”
Herman is, among other things, a champion of the overlooked, undervalued middle-aged: from meddlesome Dolly Levi to Albin, squeezing with effort into bouffant and corsets. Albin’s big number begins by reminding himself that he’s fought to establish his own identity; by the song’s end, he’s insisting that we tell the world our own truths. As the Aids crisis deepened, this wasn’t an insignificant act. In 1983, George Hearn premiered it on Broadway with bunched fists and chandelier earrings; Walter Charles took it on tour with elegant restraint. In London 25 years later, Douglas Hodge’s gurgling Albin made it sound like a nervous breakdown in a glitter ball, while world-weary Roger Allam had more than a touch of Ena Sharples: being yourself is hard work, but what else can you do? Herman’s showstoppers are relentless: they sink their teeth into you with bulldog grit and drag you along, chorus after chorus. The effect is delirious, but exhausting. Waiters pour down the staircase to welcome Dolly; Mame is feted in an everlasting cakewalk. Broadway composer Frank Loesser, Herman’s early mentor, doodled the effect of his songs as a speeding train with a bright scarlet final carriage. They start slow, then pick up momentum and make like a freight train towards an ovation-hungry kicker.
Away from the show, I Am … has been a lip-synch love bomb, of course it has. This summer, it provided the Pride theme for Belfast club Harland and Poof (“because at the end of the day, you are what you are. Let’s get fucked up, motherfuckers!”). It naturally slotted into Shirley Bassey’s repertoire – though the diva hardly struggles for self-belief – and attained disco fervour with Gloria Gaynor. But it isn’t necessarily a solo: it resonates on a communal scale. In 2017, a flash mob sang out in Sydney after Australia voted to support same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, in 2012 it capped the opening ceremony for London’s Paralympics – a firework-igniting extravaganza including a hands-in-the-air Ian McKellen, a vast sculpture of artist Alison Lapper and, at its leather-lunged centre, Beverley Knight leading the 80,000-strong crowd in an adapted chorus: “I am some-body, I am what I am.”
Identity politics have become ever less cut and dried since Popeye sang, “I yam what I yam and that’s all what I yam – I’m Popeye the sailor man” and since Herman gave voice to an individual’s essential core. We still ricochet between apology and assertion, between private and social identity. But perhaps there’s still a frisson to planting a heel on the floor and snarling with Albin: “Life’s not worth a damn till you can say, / Hey world, I am what I am!”",2019-12-30 10:50:26,90769
commentisfree/2022/jun/27/denmark-ghetto-law-eviction-non-western-residents-housing-estates,Opinion,"If you think Denmark is all Borgen and social equality, take a look at its awful ‘ghetto’ law | Hettie O'Brien",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/27/denmark-ghetto-law-eviction-non-western-residents-housing-estates,"We make a habit of idealising Scandinavia. Living in Britain, a country of damp sandwiches, dilapidated housing and extortionate gas bills, makes it easy to fantasise about places like Denmark, with its generous welfare state and 37-hour working week. We laud its social philosophies, binge on its politics as dramatised by TV’s Borgen. The idealised version of this looks like a social democratic utopia in which the state takes care of your worries. It does not look like the experiences of Muhammad Aslam, a taxi driver I spoke to recently while visiting Denmark. Aslam’s story is one that proponents of the Nordic model do not want you to hear. It reveals a darker side to this cosy ideal. And it shows that when the state considers you an outsider, its generous provisions can be swiftly withdrawn and something dystopian can take their place. Aslam has lived on the estate since 1987. For all that time, his home has been Mjølnerparken, a leafy public housing estate of squat red-brick blocks in the centre of Copenhagen (Aslam is the chairman of its residents association). His children were born and grew up here; one has just finished law school, the other is an engineer. From his balcony, Aslam can hear the sound of children playing in the courtyards below, mixed with the chattering voices of their parents and grandparents. Local nurseries use the estate’s green spaces, and every summer, Mjølnerparken hosts a party for teenage residents who have finished school. More than an estate, this is a community. But the government has classified Mjølnerparken as a “ghetto”, and plans to slash its public housing stock to no more than 40% of the total. Last month, Aslam received a letter informing him that he has until September to move out of his home. This all stems from a 2018 law intended to eradicate all ghettoes in Denmark by 2030. And the Danish state decides whether areas are deemed ghettoes not just by their crime, unemployment or education rates, but on the proportion of residents who are deemed “non-western” – meaning recent, first-, or second-generation migrants. Aslam and most others living in Mjølnerparken are Danish citizens but, as they were not born in western countries, they are treated as foreigners in their own homes. Aslam’s children were born in Denmark, attended Danish schools and have Danish university degrees. Because their father was born in Pakistan, they too are deemed “non-western”. This is not a story of gentrification or the hidden hand of the market, pricing people out of city centres. It is worse than that. It is, in effect, state-directed population control. A real estate investor, NREP, has already bought 260 of the flats on the estate. Once people like Aslam have been removed, the company plans to increase the rent on their former homes by more than 50%. Residents will be rehoused, but they will have no control over location or cost. Their children will need to move schools; their communities will be broken up. “What have I and my family done? Why do we have to be removed? My kids and my family have done nothing wrong,” Aslam says. What is playing out on this estate is far from just a local issue. In 2017, the country’s parliament expressed concern that people they considered true Danes were becoming a minority in some areas. The ghetto law was passed the following year. By breaking up these communities, the government hopes to confront what it calls “parallel societies”. This phrase recurs so often in Denmark that it borders on a collective paranoia: the fear that areas that are home to large numbers of minority and Muslim citizens risk splintering a national culture. The ghetto law was the invention of Denmark’s previous rightwing government. Yet it is now being enforced by the left-leaning Social Democrat government, in an attempt to shore up support among voters it worries will otherwise be lost to the right. This matters not just in Denmark but in Britain, too. It is often said that leftwing parties must placate the cultural anxieties of left-behind voters if they are to stave off the electoral threat from the right. This is visible in the distinction drawn between “somewheres” and “anywheres”, the argument that working-class Labour votes collapsed because people feel like “strangers in their own country”, or in the books that give an academic sheen to the troubling idea that the “racial self-interest” of white citizens is not the same thing as racism. Some have even appeared to suggest, much like the Danish government, that whether you’re truly British is defined on the basis of your ethnicity.
Denmark’s Social Democrat party has been praised by British commentators as a lesson in how to achieve integration and as a model for neutralising the right. Mjølnerparken shows just how ugly these ideas are in practice. It should be a lesson: travel down this path, and you will find yourself forcefully ripping apart communities in the name of social harmony. Few residents of Mjølnerparken would deny the estate has its problems. Unemployment and crime rates are higher than average, and overcrowding is an issue. Scratch the surface, though, and you’ll find many stories that defy this picture: Ibrahim Kadoura, an electrician who has lived here since 1992, tells me with pride about his son’s place at medical school and his daughter’s senior role at a consultancy firm. The government sees the problems on such estates as the product of migrants failing to integrate, but residents know it’s more complicated. The job market discriminates against people with Middle Eastern and non-Danish surnames, while many people struggle to find jobs simply because they live on a stigmatised estate like Mjølnerparken. Breaking up the estate would destroy a supportive community and do little to address the discrimination its residents face. Conformity is central to Danish culture. Believing that people are similar to you and share your values can be useful in maintaining support for a welfare state. But there is a darker side implicit in this requirement: if the country’s generous welfare state is uniquely Danish, then migrants and outsiders who are not considered truly Danish are easily characterised as a threat to it. “The most important thing, when people live with each other, is tolerance – ‘I will accept you, and you will accept me’,” Kadoura says. “I accept the Danish people. But it feels like they cannot accept me.” Hettie O’Brien is a writer and assistant opinion editor at the Guardian",2022-06-27 09:00:08,148691
football/2021/sep/22/millwall-leicester-city-carabao-cup-match-report,Football,Leicester progress at Millwall’s expense after Ademola Lookman punishes error,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/sep/22/millwall-leicester-city-carabao-cup-match-report,"Leicester City eased their way into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup, seeing off an eager but limited Millwall thanks to a neat finish from one-time local boy Ademola Lookman, and a late second from the persevering Kelechi Iheanacho. This was a slow-burn cup tie and a performance from Brendan Rodgers’ team that was notable only for the isolated moments of quality that made the difference. “We had really good control of the game,” Rodgers’ assistant Chris Davies said afterwards, but perhaps the most significant note was the edge offered by Iheanacho in his second start of the season.
Leicester have been a stodgy attacking presence of late. Iheanacho had a hand in both goals, finishing his own late chance with elan, spanking the ball high into the net. “He’s had to be patient but he knows how important he is for us,” Davies said. The Den was a rowdy place at kick-off on a soft blue South London night, the towers of Canary Wharf glinting above the lip of the Dockers Stand. Millwall are 18th in the Championship, but came into this tie on a cautious upswing after a run of low-scoring draws. Gary Rowett’s team lined up in a Christmas tree-style back three here, without the outstanding attacking presence of the injured Jed Wallace. This was Leicester’s first Carabao Cup date of the season, the Europa League having provided an off-games note to this point. But it was still a game that carried an unexpected urgency after five games running without a clean sheet. Here Rodgers paired Iheanacho with Lookman in attack. Youri Tielemans and Wilfred Ndidi both started in midfield. Iheanacho was lively early on, skating about looking for the gaps down the sides of the towering Millwall centre-backs, but there was a lack of intensity in the Leicester midfield. They almost fell behind on 15 minutes as Jake Cooper’s presence caused some confusion after a long throw. The ball fell to Billy Mitchell, who shot powerfully wide with the home fans already leaping up in celebration. Moments later Ndidi was robbed as he dithered outside the Leicester area, and Connor Mahoney spanked a low, hard drive that Danny Ward scooped away by his near post. Otherwise the first half was a slow congealment. Iheanacho had one more glimpse of goal but was let down by some clunky control. Mahoney offered speed and craft on the Millwall right. Leicester lacked until Tielemans began to pick up the ball in those half spaces off the back of the midfield just before the break. Twice he was fouled close to the edge of the area, the second time rising to curl the ball just over the bar. It was as close as Leicester came to a shot on target in a barren first period.
With the game still in standby mode they took the lead four minutes into the second half. The goal was made by a hair-tearing defensive error, as Ryan Leonard dithered over a throw inside his own half, then hurled the ball across the pitch towards Cooper, who was swamped by turquoise shirts as his own midfield looked on. The ball broke to Iheanacho, who had time to steady himself, ponder the scrolling perfume adverts behind the goal, and shoot for the corner. Long palmed his effort into the path of Lookman who smashed the bouncing ball into the top corner. Lookman went to school in Nunhead, a mile or so from the Den. He buzzed about with some intent during his 65 minutes on the pitch. At the other end Millwall had offered a diffuse but persistent intensity and the occasional set-piece but there was a raising of the throttle as the midfield showed more willingness to press high up the pitch. Rowett threw on Matt Smith, a regular goalscorer but a centre-forward who rumbles about the pitch with the air of a mobile crane being winched into place. But Millwall found little in the way of edge before Iheanacho made it two at the end.",2021-09-22 21:03:59,132381

science/2018/aug/23/lost-worlds-revisited-the-hidden-life-of-plant-roots,Science,"Plant roots evolved at least twice, and step by step | Susannah Lydon",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/23/lost-worlds-revisited-the-hidden-life-of-plant-roots,"Most of us do not spend much time contemplating plant roots. Not only do they suffer from the wider issue of plant blindness, but they are also the bit of the plant that is not visible. In terms of getting people excited about plant science, it’s a tough gig. This is a shame, because plant roots are critical to all of our lives: no roots means no food. Roots provide anchorage, and allow plants to gain water and nutrients from the soil. They also form a key symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which provide minerals from the soil in return for a steady supply of carbs from the plant. In the modern world, we can easily divide plants into the ones that have roots and the ones that don’t. The flowering plants (angiosperms) and the other vascular plant groups (conifers and other seed plants, ferns, horsetails and clubmosses) all have a recognisable root, defined by having a meristem of rapidly-dividing, undifferentiated cells, and by having a root cap, which protects the apex of the growing root and which is where the plant perceives gravity. The other, non-vascular, land plants – mosses and liverworts - lack the plumbing to move water and food around their bodies, and also lack true roots. These plants do have rhizoids, which are simple, hair-like structures, analogous to the root hairs on the surface of a flowering plant root. Rhizoids are used for water transport, and some may be involved in nutrient transport, but they aren’t fully-functioning roots.
We know that rhizoids have been around for a very long time. The Rhynie Chert is an amazing window into the past. It preserves a 407m-year-old hydrothermal wetlands ecosystem in astonishing, cellular detail. Most of the early land plants found in the Rhynie Chert have rhizoids, but until now nothing anything like a true root organ had been recognised. A new study by Alexander Hetherington and Liam Dolan, published in the Journal Nature, describes root meristems from the Rhynie Chert, belonging to a plant called Asteroxylon mackiei. Asteroxylon is a lycopsid, the group of land plants which includes small modern clubmosses such as Selaginella, and the extinct giant Lepidodendron forest trees of the Coal Measures. What Asteroxylon does not have is a root cap. The five apices of root-like structures that the researchers found (from examining 641 thin section slides from museum and university collections across the UK) are covered by a continuous layer of epidermis over the meristem and no tapering root cap, seen in all modern plants with roots, is present. Given the exceptional preservation of everything else, the authors ruled out a preservational reason for its absence. They also showed that the cellular organisation within three of the apices indicated that they actively growing when they were preserved, so the root caps were not lost because growth had stopped. The orientations of cell walls, indicating cell division patterns within the meristem, also ruled out the formation of a root cap. Root hairs, present in modern true roots, are also completely absent in Asteroxylon.
All of this evidence adds up to a startling conclusion: since modern clubmosses do have true roots with root caps, true roots have evolved (at least) twice: once, in a step-wise fashion, in the lycopsid branch, with Asteroxylon (with a meristem, but without root cap or root hairs) representing an intermediate stage, and independently in all the rest of the vascular land plants. The similarity in root anatomy between clubmosses and all other vascular plants is a case of convergent evolution. One of the very first blog posts I wrote for Lost Worlds Revisited back in 2016 was also about fossil root meristems, and at the time I remember feeling really lucky to have found a platform to share palaeobotanical discoveries with a far wider audience than they would ever normally get. Sadly, with the imminent closure of the Guardian’s Science Blog Network, this is my last blog post. It’s been a wonderful experience, working with the finest team of palaeo bloggers (thanks Dave, Elsa, Hanneke and Mark!), and I will miss revisiting all of our lost worlds terribly.",2018-08-23 11:02:21,61477

It simply takes existing online. The cloud, which holds our photos and status updates (among other more ominous metadata), seems omniscient and constant. But what if we begin to feel uncomfortable about the footprints we’ve left across it? What if we would rather not leave years of holiday albums, new car and partner announcements, thoughtless opinion dumps and drunk timeline photos on the internet for anyone to see until the end of time? Following Facebook’s move in 2010, online spaces and social networks such as Google and Twitter have begun introducing native archive tools to their platforms. By enabling you to download a copy of your site history, archive tools help manage your digital presence without erasing it entirely. Different platforms offer different archive and download processes. Facebook makes archiving relatively easy. While logged into your account, start by finding the down-facing arrow in the top right corner of the screen and click “Settings”. This will take you to a page with sub-buttons listed on the left-hand side. There, find and click “Your Facebook information”.
Among options to view your Facebook browsing history, temporarily deactivate or permanently delete your account, is a subsection that reads: “Download your information.” From there, follow the pop-up instructions that take you to “Create file”. Wait for your data to prepare, click “Download” and you are ready to go. The downloaded Zip will include a file labelled “index.htm”. This is the easy-to-navigate copy of your Facebook profile. On top of the usual stuff – profile pictures, videos, statuses, messages, friends – will be data you may not know was being collected. Like the time and location of every Facebook login you have made and the keywords used to target ads to you. Over on Instagram, the process is similar. On your profile page, click the three lines in the top right corner; the Menu button. There, search “Download data”, enter your email address and wait patiently for a link to be sent containing a copy of your profile. Then you can deactivate or delete your profile without losing anything you’ve put into it. If you would rather archive specific photos on your Instagram page without downloading and deleting your entire profile, there is an option for that too, albeit a very tedious, manual one (you’ll have to go through each picture one by one). While the process is less streamlined on Twitter, various services exist to make managing your Twitter history easier. The Verge has a comprehensive guide to Twitter cleanups that includes reviews of free and paid services. Depending on the platform, archiving and erasing your digital presence is a simple, one-and-done addition to your life admin to-do list. But if it all gets too complex, don’t forget there exists an easier option: all it takes is turning all your social media accounts, and digital life, to “Private”.",2022-01-28 19:00:30,138937
music/2019/jan/25/the-wombats-review-o2-academy-glasgow,Music,The Wombats review – all hail the quintessential middling indie band,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/25/the-wombats-review-o2-academy-glasgow,"If you’re pondering the continuing existence of late-noughties punky funsters the Wombats and wondering if there hasn’t been some sort of massive cosmic mix-up, an epic glitch in the matrix, you are probably not alone. Unassumingly named after a short, fat marsupial and best known for an annoying song about ironic indie disco dancing to Joy Division, surely nobody can be more surprised than this Liverpudlian three-piece that their career not only survives but thrives, heading towards Wembley Arena on a major tour. Seeded towards the end of the last decade among a minor wave of chart-bothering milksop guitar-pop bands such as Scouting for Girls and Plain White T’s, for whom shaggy hair, skinny jeans, T-shirts and trainers were uniform (and on tonight’s evidence, still are), longevity never looked likely. In this guitar-averse age of pop and mumble rap they should be remembered as a kind of Blink-and-you-missed-them 182. But their songs are shrilly shrieked throughout by an IDs-out-at-the-bar young audience who, unless the Wombats’ debut was big among the under-10s back in 2007, suggests their popularity continues to respawn.
If you thought people had long since tired of three-chord shouty pogoing, lyrics about Bridget Jones and songs kookily dedicated to pet dogs, you’d be wrong. Even one of those traditional signifiers that a band has reached a certain threshold of established respectability – as the show is paused for a moment and a guy called Callum is given a pre-requested opportunity to propose to his girlfriend ahead of the couple’s favourite song – descends into sniggering farce as Callum proves elusive. “He’s back-doored it,” reckons drummer Dan Haggis. Either that or he has taken the most ill-timed toilet trip of his life. When the Wombats are good – on the bittersweet Pink Lemonade for instance, in which singer Matthew Murphy fizzes about his inadequacies and whether or not his girlfriend is cheating on him with a cooler guy – they’re really not bad. When they’re bad – Techno Fan is a toe-curling pretend electro song essentially about how Murphy isn’t really one for techno music – they’re really very bad. But for the most part – be it Bee-Sting, a kind stodgy take on Beck’s Up All Night, or a stormy-swelling Foals-lite new song usefully titled I Don’t Know Why I Like You But I Do – they are simply OK, the quintessence of the three-star middling indie band. Their off-the-shelf melodicism, nimble rhythms and muddling lyrics – “I brought a lemon to a knife fight” gabs Murphy during one recent single, in a mixed metaphor worthy of Matt Goss – gets songs where they need to go. Their idea of progressivism is forays into self-amused synth-pop like the ravey-blaring Give Me a Try and Tokyo (Vampires & Wolves). But as relentlessly upbeat and energetic exercises in not taking music too seriously come, it would be churlish to begrudge the Wombats their unlikely durability or to sneer at the cheerfully uncomplicated relationship their fans share with their songs. During the kids-party-on-poppers apogee of Let’s Dance to Joy Division, they troll po-faced zealots of moody post-punk as giant coloured balloons bounce over the audience’s heads, four people dressed as actual wombats invade the stage and everyone goes bananas to a chant of: “Yeah, we’re so happy, we’re so happy!” At O2 Academy, Glasgow, on 25 January, and First Direct Arena, Leeds, on 26 January.

The boat is moored in the harbour of Port Adriano. The unnamed man, who has been employed for the past 10 years as a mechanic on the Lady Anastasia, Mikheev’s 48-metre, £5m yacht, said he felt he had to do something after seeing footage of a Russian rocket attack on a block of flats in Kyiv, his home town. The defendant told the judge that he believed the rocket had been manufactured by Mikheev’s company. Once on board the vessel he told the crew members, most of whom are also Ukrainians, to abandon ship. He allegedly then went to the engine room and opened a large valve in an attempt to sink the yacht. The crew members, aided by port staff, intervened to prevent the sinking. “The owner of this yacht is a criminal who makes his living selling arms that are now being used to kill Ukrainians,” he told police when he was arrested. He was released several hours later, pending charges. Meanwhile, one of two yachts undergoing a refit in the MB92 superyacht shipyard in Barcelona slipped away at the weekend after 146 days in the yard. The Galactica Super Nova, owned by Vagit Alekperov, who has a 20% stake in Lukoil, a company already subject to US sanctions, set sail for Tivat in Montenegro, which is not in the EU. The superyacht Solaris, property of Roman Abramovich, who announced at the weekend that he was handing the “the stewardship and care” of Chelsea to the football club’s charitable foundation, remained moored in the city’s marina, while the Aurora, which belongs to the construction magnate Andrey Molchanov, is still in dry dock.",2022-02-28 14:04:32,140366
business/2020/mar/31/wework-us-coronavirus-outbreak-business,Business,WeWork responds to coronavirus by telling cleaning staff to keep working,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/wework-us-coronavirus-outbreak-business,"Cleaning staff at WeWork, the troubled office rental company, have been told to continue to come in during the Covid-19 pandemic and must use their paid time off or limited sick leave if they become ill, according to an internal document seen by the Guardian. The Guardian obtained an internal document provided to cleaning staff contracted by WeWork through JLL (Jones Lang Lasalle) in New York on how to respond to inspectors who visit WeWork office buildings to ensure essential work is being conducted. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered the shutdown of all non-essential businesses in the state on 20 March, but WeWork has kept most of its offices open, claiming some of its tenants operate essential businesses, despite the fact that most are now empty and there are reports of Covid-19 cases at some properties.
“If an inspector does not see you actively performing essential work, this may increase the likelihood of being questioned or sent home,” said the document, which provided a list of prompts for workers to follow during an inspection and a list of questions they should be prepared to answer inspectors. “Provide clear evidence of the essential work you are doing,” noted the document. A question-and-answer sheet was also provided to contracted cleaning workers on the coronavirus, which stated workers need to use their accrued paid time off or sick time if they are diagnosed with Covid-19, required to self-quarantine due to exposure, or experience reduced work hours. If an employee does not have paid time off, the document’s response is “our human resources team is currently looking into options for employees. We will provide more information as soon as possible.” Due to a recent change in WeWork’s cleaning contract, most workers have just three of four days of paid vacation accrued since the contract began in December 2019. (According to the cleaner, workers receive four hours of paid time off for every 40 hours worked.) The document also claims workers’ safety will not be in jeopardy if a coronavirus case is confirmed in a building where a WeWork office is located, claiming workers shouldn’t be concerned because the building landlord will ensure all common areas and elevators are clean. “This should not put our safety in jeopardy. In these cases, the landlord will clean all common areas including elevators, which should make it safe to enter the space,” the document states. It also reaffirms office cleaners are essential workers during shutdown orders. “If you can make it to work safely, there is work to be done,” added the document, which also deferred comments to state unemployment agencies on whether workers who resign will receive unemployment benefits. “Unemployment decisions are made by the state in which the employee lives. These decisions are not made by JLL.” A cleaning employee contracted by JLL for WeWork offices in New York, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian workers are just cleaning empty buildings. “If WeWork closes their offices they default on contracts signed by their members, thus losing tons of money. So they are keeping them open so as not to lose out. In turn, JLL are supplying workers to clean already clean, empty buildings,” said the cleaner. “They want us to put our lives at risk in order to maintain the cleaning contracts they have with WeWork.” As WeWork reportedly tries to renegotiate its leases in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, tenants and elected officials in New York have criticized the company for continuing to keep offices open and refusing to suspend rent for tenants. Staff at its locations have been allowed to work from home, but a memo sent out to employees has tried to entice workers to return to the offices with $100 per day bonuses. Contracted cleaning staff are not receiving any bonuses or additional compensation for working during the pandemic. “It’s business as usual,” added the WeWork cleaner. “They’re not offering anything.” WeWork declined to comment on this story, but cited press releases on office closures and coronavirus procedures. “WeWork is home to many members whose companies are essential businesses to our society – whether they be in healthcare, insurance, cleaning product supplies or others. For that reason, all WeWork locations in the US and Canada will remain open and accessible,” noted the press release. A spokesperson for JLL told the Guardian in an email: “The management of health and operations at our managed facilities is our top priority. Some of the steps we are taking include communicating with local authorities to be aware of impacts in each market, increasing the sanitation of common areas and surface spaces, and communicating with clients regarding proactively addressing workforces that support them as needed. “We encourage employees to follow preventive personal hygiene practices recommended by health organizations and to stay home and contact health professionals if they feel symptomatic or have come into contact with someone who has contracted the virus.” It declined to comment further.",2020-03-31 09:00:48,96435
business/2022/mar/30/starbucks-uk-corporation-tax-profit-administrative-expenses-royalties,Business,Starbucks pays just £5m UK corporation tax on £95m gross profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/starbucks-uk-corporation-tax-profit-administrative-expenses-royalties,"Starbucks paid just £5.4m in UK corporation tax last year despite making a gross profit of £95m. The company, which has faced years of heated criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, paid out £26.5m in royalty payments, almost five times as much the UK tax it paid, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The royalty payments helped Starbucks, which is run by the billionaire Howard Schultz, make a global profit of $4.9bn (£3.7bn) in the same period. The UK division collected sales of £328m from its 1,000 UK stores in the year to 3 October 2021, up from £243m in the previous year when shops were temporarily closed during the pandemic lockdown. Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) made a £95.1m “gross profit” for the year, but after swallowing “administrative expenses” of £78m, its pre-tax profits were reduced to £13.3m, on which it paid £5.4m tax. A year earlier the company received tax credits of £4.4m after recording a pre-tax loss of £40.9m. Starbucks said administrative costs included occupancy costs such as business rates, service fees, maintenance and utilities for stores and central costs required to run the UK business, including IT, marketing, and head office costs. The UK arm of Starbucks has made cumulative losses after tax of more than £100m between 2010 and 2021, according to a Guardian analysis of its accounts. It reported a profit in only five out of 12 years, but tax experts say it is unclear whether they are a true reflection of the business. Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, said: “Starbucks’ main UK subsidiary maintained its tradition of paying little corporation tax in the UK, and this was once again down to the payment of hefty royalty and licensing fees to entities further up the corporate group. “The numbers now have a certain predictability.” In 2012, it was revealed that Starbucks had paid just £8.6m in taxes on £3bn in UK sales since 1998, when it launched its first UK coffee shop. The company declined to comment on the royalty payments or the reasons for its very low pre-tax profits in the UK. Separate accounts show that Starbucks’ UK-based European business paid just $13m in tax last year, while paying the coffee giant’s parent company in Seattle a $164m dividend. Starbucks Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) collected royalty payments of $237m in the year to 3 October. It made a pre-tax profit of $190m, and paid $13.1m in tax. The company said the tax payment was low because “this dividend income has already been taxed in other jurisdictions before it is booked for accounting purposes as a profit in Starbucks EMEA Limited. As the income has been taxed already, it is exempt from further UK corporation tax charges.” Starbucks EMEA, which collects royalties from 43 countries including the UK, has built up shareholder funds to more than $2tn. Starbucks Corporation, the US parent company, made an “operating income” profit of $4.87bn in the year to 3 October 2021, on sales of $29bn. Shultz, who transformed Starbucks from an 11-store Seattle chain he took over in 1986 into a global coffee empire, earlier this month announced that he was returning as interim chief executive. Shultz, who has built up an estimated $4bn fortune, is rejoining for his third stint as chief executive after the retirement of Kevin Johnson.",2022-03-30 14:40:18,142512
commentisfree/2021/may/29/not-completely-terrible-semi-locked-down-celebration,Opinion,Want to have a not-completely-terrible semi-locked-down celebration? Here’s how | Hadley Freeman,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/not-completely-terrible-semi-locked-down-celebration,"Bad news, Arieans and Taureans, or – as they are known by people who don’t believe in fairytales – people with birthdays between March and May. You have just had your second crap birthday in a row. No doubt the planets foretold it all. Now that I have declared myself the Guardian’s first astrologist, I must add that all Pisceans should avoid buying a dishwasher this week and Scorpios must stay away from anyone in a Moncler jacket. (That latter one is not in the stars, it’s just a good general rule for avoiding people with too much money and no taste.) So it was my birthday the other week. I always liked that my birthday is in May, because it really is the perfect party month: late spring, so warm, but not – crucially – summer, so people generally aren’t on holiday. Also, I share my day with some genuinely interesting people: L Frank Baum! Madeleine Albright! Andy Murray! This might not say anything important about me, but it definitely doesn’t say anything bad, so I’ll take it. Clever me for being born on such a great day! At this point, you should be picturing Leonardo DiCaprio at the beginning of Titanic, clutching his ticket and shouting: “We’re the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!” Except it’s me instead of Leo, my birthday instead of a ticket, and the coronavirus instead of the Titanic. OK, not being able to have a birthday party for the second year in a row might not be quite as bad as drowning in the freezing North Atlantic because Kate Winslet wouldn’t share her massive wooden board with you. But let’s just acknowledge that having a double lockdown birthday is not great. And before anyone starts, yes, I know it wasn’t proper lockdown two weeks ago, but it may as well have been, given I wasn’t allowed to have dinner inside a restaurant and every outdoor table is booked until August, probably by people who arrange their books by colour. I was really dreading my birthday this year, to the point that I tried to ignore it, which is extremely un-me. I love my birthday, and not just because I share it with Andy Murray. For a start, it’s a better excuse than, say, Tuesday to throw a party, and I really don’t understand people who don’t like throwing parties, because why wouldn’t you want all your favourite people in one room? Also, I have no problem with the ageing process, because I was such an idiot when I was young that I have to believe I can only get better. My birthday last year was fine, because there was a certain novelty about seeing neither my friends nor my parents on it. But twice in a row was not a prospect that filled me with joy. In the end, it was OK. More than OK: it was genuinely lovely, thanks entirely to my partner who stepped in and seized control of proceedings instead of letting me sit around in a self-pitying funk.
As I write, it is very much up in the air whether all restrictions will be lifted next month (or indeed, ever), so perhaps the rest of the astrology chart will also have a second lockdown birthday. Just in case, here is what I’ve learned about how to have a not-completely-terrible semi-locked-down celebration: 1 No Zoom parties Whatever initial appeal these once held (“It’s like the opening credits of The Brady Bunch are talking to me!”) has long since been overtaken by irritation about how no one actually gets to speak and someone’s wifi always freezes. It’s like trying to have a party under water, and unless you’re related to The Little Mermaid, this is a stupid idea. Tell the people you see in person every day – your neighbours, the newsagent – that it’s your birthday, and savour their good wishes, and if you must Zoom, keep it to one person, max two. You actually get to speak, and you’ll see everyone else later. Someday. Maybe. 2 Plan nothing that’s dependent on anything Picnics, meet-ups that require an outdoor table, gatherings that depend on restrictions being lifted when promised… these rely on, respectively, the weather, luck and Boris Johnson’s integrity, all of which are as reliable as each other. Don’t make your birthday stressful; instead stick with unshakable certainties. Like food. My birthday lunch, at my kitchen table, comprised all my favourite foods and, let me tell you, neither age nor Covid can wither spaghetti with tomato sauce and homemade chocolate cake. 3 Treat yo’ self The best lesson of Parks And Recreation is the importance of a Treat Yo’ Self day – a day when the only rule is to indulge yourself – and a lockdown birthday is that day. Stay in bed and watch Parks And Rec all day! Have the biggest bubble bath in the world! Or just watch a double bill of High Society and Heathers, because it’s your birthday and you can. Maybe the outside world is overrated after all.",2021-05-29 08:00:19,123520
tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/shining-girls-review-elizabeth-moss-apple-tv,Television & radio,Shining Girls review – Elisabeth Moss is perfect for this time-hopping thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/shining-girls-review-elizabeth-moss-apple-tv,"I understand, entirely, if you are a bit done with murderers – serial, one-offs, opportunistic, take your pick from the array forever before us on our screens. Or simple terrorisers of women. But I would urge, even if that is your current position, to give Shining Girls (Apple TV+) a try, though the premise may be unalluring. The premise, taken from the 2013 novel of nearly the same name by Lauren Beukes, is that six years ago, Kirby Mazrachi (Elisabeth Moss) survived a near-fatal attack by an unknown assailant who was never caught. Since then she has been experiencing shifting realities. Sometimes the alterations are small and a pet cat is now a pet dog, or she returns to a different desk at work; sometimes they are large and she finds her hot mess of a mother reborn in a more literal sense than usual as an evangelical Christian, or that Kirby herself is now married to a man called Marcus instead of still isolated and single. One constant is that she is always a newspaper archivist with the Sun Times (her story, which is more central than in the book, is set in early 90s Chicago), the closest she could manage to her ambition of becoming a reporter in the wake of the life-changing assault. When the body of a young woman with seemingly identical but this time fatal wounds to Kirby’s is discovered in the city’s sewers, she joins forces with reporter Dan (Wagner Moura) to investigate and track down what seems to be, despite impossible timelines crisscrossing decades, a serial killer. The viewer is far ahead of them here – possibly too far, making the pair seem slightly dim rather than dogged – because we have seen the mysterious man at work. The man is Harper (played very unsettlingly and very brilliantly by Jamie Bell) and he seems unstoppable as he chooses his next victim, astronomer Jin-Sook (Phillipa Soo), whose job hints at the physics and metaphysics that will play a part in unravelling the knotty plot.
Moss is, as ever, ferociously intense and attentive to the minutest shift in her character’s mood or suffering. She is unflinching and unsentimental in every role she takes, and you couldn’t hope for a better anchor for a project that could easily otherwise become hokey. Time travel is frequently less of a high concept than a deep trap, which is why Russian Doll – also grounded by a powerhouse performance by a female lead – remains such a marvel. When you add Moss’s remarkable, nuanced performance to the slightly slow pacing and the audience being arguably too far ahead of the protagonists, Shining Girls works better as a character study than a thriller (though it’s certainly worth watching as the latter). Kirby’s constant renegotiation of a world that changes without notice or permission around her is as fine an evocation of the profound and lingering results of trauma as you’ll see. To live a life suddenly full of unknowns, with the familiar made unfamiliar, the trustworthy now tainted by terrible knowledge, is something anyone who has been assaulted will recognise. One reality is replaced by another and another and another as you take two steps forwards and one back towards a new normality. Even as the female victim count adds up, Shining Girls keeps its integrity and never backs away from this underlying truth.",2022-04-29 09:29:24,144414
football/2020/jan/26/arsenal-west-ham-womens-fa-cup-match-report,Football,Lia Wälti and Katie McCabe sink West Ham and put Arsenal back on track,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/26/arsenal-west-ham-womens-fa-cup-match-report,"Arsenal bounced back from their heavy defeat by Chelsea last weekend with an efficient FA Cup fourth-round defeat of last year’s runners-up, West Ham. A stunning side-footed volley from Lia Wälti and a first-half goal from Katie McCabe ensured the Gunners remain in the hunt in four competitions and for a 15th FA Cup title. “It was important to show a reaction because last week we were not playing the way we want to,” Wälti said, while their manager, Joe Montemurro, said he was proud of the turnaround. “The maturity of this team is that it can slow games up when it needs to; it can control games when it needs too,” he said.
The second all-WSL tie of the FA Cup fourth round was in the end routine for Arsenal but West Ham have previously tested Montemurro’s free-flowing side. Their three league meetings since the Hammers launched a women’s team and entered the top tier went Arsenal’s way but all were close – 4-3, 4-2 and, most recently, 2-1 last September. The form of Matt Beard’s West Ham team, though, has been patchy, producing only seven wins in their 15 games since that defeat, and none back to back. Beard opted for three centre-backs with the England Under-20 captain, Grace Fisk, who joined in December, slotting in alongside Gilly Flaherty and Katharina Baunach and his wing-backs dropped into a back five whenever Arsenal pressed forward. For the visiting team this game had the added importance of following their bruising 4-1 home defeat by Chelsea in the WSL. Lose and they would have gone into back-to-back games against Manchester City in the League Cup and WSL having suffered consecutive competitive defeats for the first time in 20 months. Any nerves, though, were settled early on. With the Arsenal super-fan Maria going solo in her jovial chanting battle with the home crowd, the Gunners put pressure on the tight West Ham lines. Just shy of the 20-minute mark they were one up after Kim Little raced into the penalty box, looked around and laid the ball back to McCabe, who cut inside from the left and lashed home.
Montemurro had relegated the wide players, Lisa Evans and Beth Mead, to the bench and pushed McCabe back into defence against Chelsea, sacrificing their potent width as they attempted to dominate in the middle, and it proved costly. Here they were restored to the starting XI and their more natural berths and the impact was clear with McCabe and Mead linking well. The former swung the ball to Mead at the back post but her side-footed volley was over. West Ham were not without chances of their own, Kenza Dali’s powerful cross with just a little too much in it for Julia Simic to be able to direct her header on target. “It’s the toughest draw we could have got,” Beard said. “But it shouldn’t take for me at half-time to show five clips and raise my voice a little bit for them to do it. I need to find out why it’s happening. It’s too many times I’ve had to go in at half-time and tweak things or show them exactly what we’ve asked them to do and why.” Absorbing a spell of West Ham pressure after the break, Dali collected a clearance on the edge of the box and swiped her shot off the bar for a fine effort – Arsenal looking dangerous with every attack. The England forward Mead punished the Hammers for not capitalising on their period of possession with a pinpoint delivery from a corner that Wälti beautifully converted on the volley with 17 minutes to play. It was her first Arsenal goal.",2020-01-26 15:33:21,93699
australia-news/2018/nov/28/aboriginal-led-justice-project-saves-rural-town-almost-3m,Australia news,Aboriginal-led justice project saves rural town almost $3m,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/28/aboriginal-led-justice-project-saves-rural-town-almost-3m,"A groundbreaking Aboriginal community-led justice reinvestment program to address the underlying causes of crime delivered a saving of almost $3m to the far western New South Wales town of Bourke last year. A KMPG report has also found that the initiative could deliver an additional economic impact of $7m over the next five years. Maranguka justice reinvestment is based on the idea that savings can be made through redirecting funding spent on policing and punishment to projects that help prevent offending behaviour. KPMG calculated the savings based on the reduced number of police hours taken up with responding to domestic violence incidents and other serious offences, the reduced daily cost of imprisonment, as well as fewer bail breaches, fines and other penalties in the region. It also accounted for the reduced number of Centrelink crisis payments, fewer days absent from work and school, and reduced court costs for police and defendants.
“Maranguka is a recognition that we in Australia continue to spend far too much on the end product rather than deal with the upfront,” the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said in launching the report. “I don’t share the views of some of my colleagues that imposing views from the top will ever actually be the solution,” he said. “The solution has to be empowerment of those who hold their futures in their own hands. This is a local community exercise. “Each community knows they have their own set of factors. There isn’t one answer for everybody. But the empowerment of locals to drive their own changes is something that governments of either political persuasion can support.” Of the $3.1m economic impact in 2017, KPMG said two-thirds were savings in the justice system and one-third was the broader economic benefit to the region. The report found: a 23% reduction in police-recorded incidence of domestic violence and comparable drops in rates of reoffending; a 31% increase in year 12 student retention rates and a 38% reduction in charges across the top five juvenile offence categories; a 42% reduction in days spent in custody for adults. “There is no silver bullet here. The challenge is complex and ongoing,” the chair of Just Reinvest NSW, Sarah Hopkins, said. “What we know is that the community is doing its part. After decades of feeling let down, the community is starting to see the benefits of being part of the decision-making in Bourke,” she said. “There is a resilience around a long-term change process.”",2018-11-27 21:00:17,66266
science/2022/jan/26/frog-regrows-amputated-leg-after-being-given-drug-treatment,Science,Frog regrows amputated leg after drug treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/frog-regrows-amputated-leg-after-being-given-drug-treatment,"A frog has regrown a lost leg after being treated with a cocktail of drugs in a significant advance for regenerative medicine. The African clawed frog, which is naturally unable to regenerate its limbs, was treated with the drugs for just 24 hours and this prompted an 18-month period of regrowth of a functional leg. The demonstration raises the prospect that in the future drugs could be used to switch on similar untapped abilities for regeneration in human patients to restore tissues or organs lost to disease or injury. “It’s exciting to see that the drugs we selected were helping to create an almost complete limb,” said Nirosha Murugan of Tufts University in Massachusetts and first author of the paper. “The fact that it required only a brief exposure to the drugs to set in motion a months-long regeneration process suggests that frogs and perhaps other animals may have dormant regenerative capabilities that can be triggered into action.” Many creatures are able to fully regenerate at least some limbs, including salamanders, starfish, crabs and lizards. Flatworms can even be chopped into pieces, with each piece reconstructing an entire organism. Humans have some regenerative capabilities – the liver can regrow to full size after being halved and children can regrow the tips of their fingers. However, the loss of a large, complex limb cannot be restored by any natural process in mammals. The rapid formation of scar tissue protects us from blood loss and infection, but also prevents regrowth. In the latest research, published in the journal Science Advances, the scientists amputated a frog’s hind-leg and enclosed the wound in silicone cap containing a five-drug cocktail. The drugs each had a different purpose, including reducing inflammation and the production of collagen to stop scar tissue growing. The drugs also aimed to promote the growth of new nerve fibres, blood vessels and muscle. The experiment was repeated in dozens of frogs and many of those treated had a dramatic regrowth of tissue, with many re-creating an almost fully functional leg, including bone tissue and even toe-like structures at the end of the limb. The regrown limb moved, responded to touch and the frogs were able to make use of it for swimming. In the first few days of treatment scientists observed the activation of molecular pathways that are normally used to map out limbs in the developing embryo. They believe that adult humans still retain the information needed to make body structures and that, in theory, it should be possible to tap into this dormant ability. “Covering the open wound with a liquid environment under the [silicone cap], with the right drug cocktail, could provide the necessary first signals to set the regenerative process in motion,” said Michael Levin, Vannevar Bush professor of biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts. The team now plan to test the technique in mammals. Bob Lanza, head of Astellas Global Regenerative Medicine, who was not involved in the research, described the advance as an “amazing achievement”. “The study has extremely exciting ramifications for regenerative medicine,” said Lanza. “Although frogs have much greater regenerative capacity than humans, this is a very important first step. With the right combination of drugs and factors a similar approach could potentially spur regeneration and restore lost function in humans.”
Michael Schneider, a professor in cardiology at Imperial College London, said that the findings could have applications in other areas of regeneration, such as the possibility of scarless healing, after a heart attack. “The results are highly intriguing for human regenerative medicine, beyond just their implications for the limb,” he said. “As the authors acknowledge, a crucial step to be made before any human testing will be proof that this approach, possibly with further refinements, also can be applied to mammals.”",2022-01-26 19:27:37,139403
music/2021/oct/22/bernard-haitink-refined-conducting-made-him-true-master,Music,"Bernard Haitink’s direct, refined conducting made him a true master",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/22/bernard-haitink-refined-conducting-made-him-true-master,"It’s just over two years since, at the age of 90, Bernard Haitink made his final appearance in London, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic at the Proms in two of the composers closest to his heart throughout his 65-year career on the podium, Beethoven and Bruckner. The virtues of those performances, their clarity and insight, and their utter lack of anything showy, epitomised Haitink’s strengths as an interpreter, which guaranteed his place in the pantheon of 20th-century conductors. British audiences were especially privileged for more than half a century to have had so many opportunities to appreciate Haitink’s gifts in the concert hall and opera house, beginning with his period as the principal conductor of the London Philharmonic from 1967 to 1979, then through his musical directorships at Glyndebourne (1977-88) and at the Royal Opera House (1987-2002), and finally in the relationship he established in his later years with the London Symphony Orchestra. He’d been part of my personal concert-going life in London from the 1970s, when he was one of a group of outstanding conductors – along with Claudio Abbado, Pierre Boulez, Georg Solti among others – who frequently worked in the capital; all of them would have been exceptional in any era, and I doubt any of us realised then how lucky we were to be able to hear them so regularly.
His critics would say that in comparison with some of his contemporaries, Haitink’s repertoire was unadventurous and narrow. Certainly during his years at the ROH he conducted no Puccini, relatively little Verdi (though his performances of Don Carlos were tremendous), and steered well clear of the bel canto repertoire. But for his admirers, his commitment to Mozart, Wagner and Janáček especially, more than made up for that. He avoided contemporary music, rarely conducting any composer later than Shostakovich, but he did also explore some 20th-century British music. His recordings of Elgar and Vaughan Williams symphonies still stand up well, and at Covent Garden he did conduct both Britten’s Peter Grimes and Michael Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage at Covent Garden. In their distinctive, refined way, his performances of Debussy and Stravinsky were sometimes exceptional too, but it was as an interpreter of the mainstream symphonic repertoire from Beethoven to Mahler that he excelled with every orchestra he conducted, whether it was the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Dresden Staatskapelle, or the Boston or Chicago Symphonies. He’d been one of the prime movers in the Mahler revival of the 1960s, completing a recorded cycle of the symphonies with the Concertgebouw Orchestra as early as 1971, and recording the Bruckner canon in the same period too, all performances that half a century on seem as convincing as ever.
But if I had to choose just one Haitink performance that encapsulated his greatness it would be the account of Mahler’s Third Symphony that he conducted with the Berlin Philharmonic at the Barbican in London in 2004. The Third was always a work that suited his musical virtues of directness and structural integrity exceptionally well; that performance, so eloquent, so superbly played and without a moment of self-regard, conveyed them incomparably. And in my experience, the man himself was like his music-making, serious, sincere and direct; he was never one for grand public pronouncements or attention-seeking gestures. There were times, especially when he was at Covent Garden during its difficult years in the 1990s, that a higher public profile and more obvious involvement in solving its problems might have been welcomed, but it always was the music that mattered to him, and he always put that first.",2021-10-22 16:03:19,134451
